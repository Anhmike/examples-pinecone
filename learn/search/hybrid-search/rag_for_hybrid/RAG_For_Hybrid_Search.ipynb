       " 'Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a funda- mental building block in information retrieval with graph- based indices being the current state-of-the-art [7] and widely used in the industry. Recent advances [51] in graph-based in- dices have made it possible to index and search billion-point datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity machine with an SSD.',\n",
       " 'However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email or a news index). To overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be prohibitively expensive.',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS in- dex that reflects corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search performance. Using update tules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes and searches per second each, while retaining > 95% 5-recall@5. This represents a 5-10x reduc- tion in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices when compared to existing methods.',\n",

       " 'In the Nearest Neighbor Search problem, we are given a dataset P of points along with a pairwise distance function. The goal is to design a data structure that, given a target k and a query point q, efficiently retrieves the k closest neigh- bors for q in the dataset P according to the given distance function. This fundamental problem is well studied in the research community [6, 9, 11, 16, 32, 35, 38, 43, 59] and is a critical component for diverse applications in computer vision [57], data mining [19], information retrieval [44], clas- sification [26], and recommendation systems [21], to name a few. As advances in deep learning have made embedding- based approaches the state-of-the-art in these applications, there has been renewed interest in the problem at scale. Sev- eral open-source inverted-index based search engines now support NNS [49, 50, 55], and new search engines based on',\n",

In newer applications of this problem, the dataset to be indexed and the queries are the output of a deep learning model — objects such as sentences or images are mapped so that semantically similar objects are mapped to closer points [10, 23]. These points reside in a space of dimension d (typically 100-1000), and the distance function is the Euclidean distance (¢) or cosine similarity (which is identical to f, when the data is normalized).',\n",
       " 'Since it is impossible to retrieve the exact nearest neigh- bors without a cost linear in the size of the dataset in the general case (see [32, 59]) due to a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality [20], one aims to find the approx- imate nearest neighbors (ANN) where the goal is to retrieve k neighbors that are close to being optimal. The quality of an ANN algorithm is judged by the trade-off it provides be- tween accuracy and the hardware resources such as compute, memory and I/O consumed for the search.',\n",
       " 'Even though this abstraction of ANN search is widely studied, it does not capture many important real-world sce- narios where user interactions with a system creates and destroys data, and results in updates to P (especially in the literature on graph-based ANNS indices [58]). For example, consider an enterprise-search scenario where the system in- dexes sentences in documents generated by users across an enterprise. Changes to sentences in a document would cor- respond to a set of new points inserted and previous points deleted. Another scenario is an email server where arrival and deletion of emails correspond to insertion and deletion of points into an ANNS index. ANNS systems for such ap- plications would need to host indices containing trillions of points with real-time updates that can reflect changes to the corpus in user searches, ideally in real-time.',\n",
       " 'Motivated by such scenarios, we are interested in solv- ing the fresh-ANNS problem, where the goal is to support ANNS on a continually changing set of points. Formally, we define the fresh-ANNS problem thus: given a time varying dataset P (with state P; at time t), the goal is to maintain a dynamic index that computes the approximate nearest neighbors for any query q issued at time t only on the active dataset P;. Such a system must support three operations (a) insert a new point, (b) delete an existing point, and (c) search for the nearest neighbors given a query point. The overall quality of a fresh-ANNS system is measured by:',\n",

Indeed, the current state-of-art system for fresh-ANNS which can support comparable update and search performance on a billion-point dataset is based on the classical LSH algorithm [54], and requires a hundred ma- chines of 32GB RAM (translating to around 25 machines of our stated configuration). In this work, we seek to reduce this deployment cost down to a single machine per billion points.

For example, the state-of-art system for streaming similarity search (or fresh-ANNS), PLSH [54], is a parallel and distributed LSH-based mechanism. While it offers com- parable update throughput and search performance as our system, it ends up needing 25X more machines due to the high RAM consumption. A similar issue can be seen with',\n",

Moreover, the algorithm only handles insertions, and simply performs a variant of blacklisting for deletions, and hence would need periodic rebuilding. Finally, there are other classes of ANNS algorithms such as kd-Tree [14], Cover Trees [17] which support reasonably efficient update policies, but these algorithms work well only when the data dimen- sionality is moderately small (under 20); their performance drops when the data dimensionality is 100 or more which is typical for points generated by deep-learning models..',\n",

These algorithms are also widely used in the industry at scale. However, all known graph indices are static and do not support updates, especially delete re- quests [18], possibly due to the fact that simple graph modi- fication rules for insertions and deletions do not retain the same graph quality over a stream of insertions and deletions.',\n",

So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion- point index.

There have been some recent advances in maintaining several trees and combining them with new ideas to develop good algorithms such as FLANN [46] and Annoy [15].

Im- plementations which make use of auxiliary storage such as SRS [53] typically have several orders of magnitude slower query latencies compared to the graph-based algorithms. Other hashing-based methods [37, 42, 48] learn an optimal hash family by exploiting the neighborhood graph.

Greedy search cannot improve distance to the query point by navigating out of p* and returns it as the candidate nearest neighbor for query q. Algorithm 1 describes a variant of this greedy search algorithm that returns k nearest neighbor candidates. Index Build consists of constructing a navigable graph. The graph is typically built to achieve two contrasting objectives to minimize search complexity: (i) make the greedy search algorithm applied to each base point p € P in the vertex set converge to p in the fewest iterations (intuitively, this would ensure that Algorithm 1 converges to p when searching for a query Xq if p is the nearest-neighbor for xq), and (ii) have a maximum out-degree of at most R for all p € P, a parameter typically between 16 — 128.',\n",

Fur- ther, StreamingMerge scales near linearly with the number of threads (see Figure 7). While the Delete phase scales lin- early, the Patch and Insert phases scale sub-linearly due to intensive SSD I/O. Using fewer threads also results in more predictable search latencies (esp. 99% latency) due to the reduced SSD contention. This allows us to set the number of threads StreamingMerge uses to meet the desired update rate — 3600 updates/sec require 40 threads, but if we were only required to support 1000 updates/sec, we could choose to run StreamingMerge with 10 threads, and take advantage of higher search throughput and predictable latencies.',\n",

Using up- date rules from FreshVamana, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge procedure which reflects these updates into an SSD-resident index with minimal write amplification. Using FreshVamana and StreamingMerge, we develop and rigorously evaluate FreshDiskANN, a highly-scalable fresh- ANNS system that can maintain a dynamic index of a billion points on a commodity machine while concurrently support- ing inserts, deletes, and search operations at millisecond- scale latencies.',\n",

       " 'Any non-trivial computation in the delete phase happens only for undeleted points p € P which have neighbors from the delete list. For each such point p, Algorithm 4 applies the pruning process on the candidate list consisting of the undeleted neighbors of p and the undeleted neighbors of the deleted neighbors of p to select the best R points from to its updated neighborhood. In order to perform an average-case analysis, let us assume that the delete set D is a randomly chosen set from the active points P, and suppose |P| = N and PI = B. The expected size of the candidate list will be R(1 — B) + R’B(1 — B). Here the first term accounts for undeleted neighbors of p and the second term accounts for undeleted neighbors of deleted neighbors of p. The expected number of undeleted points in the index is N(1 — ). Therefore the total number of expected operations in the delete phase will be proportional to NR(1— f)? (1 + Rf). This assumes that the complexity of the prune procedure is linear in the size of the candidate list which we validated empirically below. For large values of , the (1— )? term is diminishingly small and the deletion phase is quick. For small values of £ (around 5%— 10%) and typical values of R € [64, 128], RB > 1',\n",

Recent advances [51] in graph-based in- dices have made it possible to index and search billion-point datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity machine with an SSD.',\n",
       " 'However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email or a news index). To overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be prohibitively expensive.',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS in- dex that reflects corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search performance. Using update tules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes and searches per second each, while retaining > 95% 5-recall@5. This represents a 5-10x reduc- tion in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices when compared to existing methods.',\n",

The goal is to design a data structure that, given a target k and a query point q, efficiently retrieves the k closest neigh- bors for q in the dataset P according to the given distance function. This fundamental problem is well studied in the research community [6, 9, 11, 16, 32, 35, 38, 43, 59] and is a critical component for diverse applications in computer vision [57], data mining [19], information retrieval [44], clas- sification [26], and recommendation systems [21], to name a few. As advances in deep learning have made embedding- based approaches the state-of-the-art in these applications, there has been renewed interest in the problem at scale.

In newer applications of this problem, the dataset to be indexed and the queries are the output of a deep learning model — objects such as sentences or images are mapped so that semantically similar objects are mapped to closer points [10, 23]. These points reside in a space of dimension d (typically 100-1000), and the distance function is the Euclidean distance (¢) or cosine similarity (which is identical to f, when the data is normalized).',\n",
       " 'Since it is impossible to retrieve the exact nearest neigh- bors without a cost linear in the size of the dataset in the general case (see [32, 59]) due to a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality [20], one aims to find the approx- imate nearest neighbors (ANN) where the goal is to retrieve k neighbors that are close to being optimal. The quality of an ANN algorithm is judged by the trade-off it provides be- tween accuracy and the hardware resources such as compute, memory and I/O consumed for the search.',\n",

For example, consider an enterprise-search scenario where the system in- dexes sentences in documents generated by users across an enterprise. Changes to sentences in a document would cor- respond to a set of new points inserted and previous points deleted. Another scenario is an email server where arrival and deletion of emails correspond to insertion and deletion of points into an ANNS index.

Indeed, the current state-of-art system for fresh-ANNS which can support comparable update and search performance on a billion-point dataset is based on the classical LSH algorithm [54], and requires a hundred ma- chines of 32GB RAM (translating to around 25 machines of our stated configuration). In this work, we seek to reduce this deployment cost down to a single machine per billion points. To handle trillion-point indices (as in web-search scenar- ios), one can employ a simple distributed approach wherein thousand machines host a billion points each — queries are broadcast and results aggregates while updates are routed to the appropriate nodes.',\n",

       " 'Of all the algorithms for static-ANNS, the ones most easily capable of supporting streaming support are the ones based on simple hashing algorithms such as LSH (locality sensitive hashing). However, these algorithms suffer from either being too memory intensive, needing to store hundreds of hash functions in main memory, or become extremely slow for query processing when the index is stored on secondary storage. For example, the state-of-art system for streaming similarity search (or fresh-ANNS), PLSH [54], is a parallel and distributed LSH-based mechanism. While it offers com- parable update throughput and search performance as our system, it ends up needing 25X more machines due to the high RAM consumption. A similar issue can be seen with',\n",

Alternately, disk-based LSH indices such as SRS [53] can host a billion-point index on a single machine, but the query latencies are extremely slow with the system fetch- ing around 15% of the total index (running into GBs per query) from the disk to provide good accuracy. Another re- cent algorithm HD-Index [5] can serve a billion-point index with just a few megabytes of RAM footprint, but it suffers from search latencies of a few seconds to get accuracy of around 30%. Moreover, the algorithm only handles insertions, and simply performs a variant of blacklisting for deletions, and hence would need periodic rebuilding. Finally, there are other classes of ANNS algorithms such as kd-Tree [14], Cover Trees [17] which support reasonably efficient update policies, but these algorithms work well only when the data dimen- sionality is moderately small (under 20); their performance drops when the data dimensionality is 100 or more which is typical for points generated by deep-learning models..',\n",
       " 'At the other end of the spectrum of ANNS indices are graph-based indexing algorithms [28, 33, 34, 43, 51, 52]. Sev- eral comparative studies [7, 25, 41, 58] of ANNS algorithms have concluded that they significantly out-perform other techniques in terms of search throughput on a range of real- world static datasets. These algorithms are also widely used in the industry at scale. However, all known graph indices are static and do not support updates, especially delete re- quests [18], possibly due to the fact that simple graph modi- fication rules for insertions and deletions do not retain the same graph quality over a stream of insertions and deletions.',\n",
       " 'As a result, the current practice in industry is to period- ically re-build such indices from scratch [18] to manifest recent changes to the underlying dataset. However, this is a very expensive operation. It would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good qual- ity HNSW index [47] over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion- point index. This is apart from the cost of actually serving the indices, which would again be anywhere between one for DRAM-SSD hybrid indices [51] to four for in-memory in- dices [47] depending on the exact algorithm being deployed. This paper aims to serve and update an index over a billion points with real-time freshness using just one machine. This represents a significant cost advantage for web and enterprise-scale search platforms that need to serve indices spanning trillions of points.',\n",

Beyond ANNS for points in Euclidean spaces, there has been work for tailored inputs and other notions of similarity such as those for time series data, e.g., [1, 19, 40]. The work [25] provides a comprehensive study of such algorithms and their applicability.',\n",

For such points, spa- tial partitioning ideas such as R*-trees [13], kd-trees [14] and Cover Trees [16] work well, but these typically do not scale well for high-dimensional data owing to the curse of dimensionality. There have been some recent advances in maintaining several trees and combining them with new ideas to develop good algorithms such as FLANN [46] and Annoy [15]. However, they are built for static indices, and moreover, even here, the graph-based algorithms outperform them [7] on most datasets.',\n",

In a breakthrough result, Indyk and Motwani [32] show that a class of algorithms, known as locality sensitive hashing can yield provably approximate solutions to the ANNS problem with a polynomially-sized index and sub- linear query time. Subsequent to this work, there has been a plethora of different LSH-based algorithms [3, 32, 62], in- cluding those which depend on the data [4], use spectral methods [61], distributed LSH [54], etc. While the advan- tage of the simpler data-independent hashing methods are that updates are almost trivial, the indices are often entirely resident in DRAM and hence do not scale very well. Im- plementations which make use of auxiliary storage such as SRS [53] typically have several orders of magnitude slower query latencies compared to the graph-based algorithms. Other hashing-based methods [37, 42, 48] learn an optimal hash family by exploiting the neighborhood graph.

These methods offer good guarantees on weaker notions such as 1-recall@100, which is the likelihood that the true nearest neighbor for a query appears in a list of 100 candidates output by the algorithm.

In order to mitigate the accuracy loss due to PQ, VGPQ search performs a large number of distance compu- tations and incurs high search latencies. As distributed sys- tem over several powerful nodes, the model has low search throughput even when no inserts and deletes are going on. Hence, such a system cannot be used in high-throughput scenarios.',\n",

As a result, their aggregate search throughput on a billion point index spread across disks on 16 machines is lesser than the throughput of FreshDiskANN with one machine. Our work achieves this by designing an on-SSD updatable graph index which is far more efficient for search. Their insertion throughput on an index spread across 70 machines is also much lesser than that of FreshDiskANN on one machine.',\n",

       " 'Variations in Search Latency During StreamingMerge. The middle plot in Figure 6 shows that the user-perceived search latencies varies across based on the phase of the StreamingMerge process in progress. Since the Insert phase generates a significant number of random reads to the LTI index which interfere with the random read requests issued by the search threads, it results in slightly higher latencies. On the other hand, while the typical latencies are smaller during the Delete and Patch phases of StreamingMerge, the latencies occasionally spike as high as 40ms, which we',\n",

       " 'think is likely due to head-of-line blocking by the large se- quential read and write operations that copy the LTI index to and from the main memory.',\n",
       " 'Update Throughput of System. While FreshDiskANN pro- vides latencies of about 1ms for insert (Figure 6) and 0.1: for delete (since they are simply added to a DeleteList), in practice they need to be throttled so that the in-memory TempIndex do not grow too large before the ongoing back- ground merge completes. As a result, the speed of the merge operation dictates the update rates the system can sustain over long periods of time. The threads allocation described above helps us control the rate of external insert and delete operations to what the StreamingMerge procedure can com- plete before the TempIndex grows to 30M points.',\n",
       " 'To better understand the thread allocation, we record the time taken for the StreamingMerge process to merge 30M inserts into an index of size roughly 800M using T = 40 threads. This takes around 8400s per cycle. To prevent the TempIndex from growing too much while the merge proce- dure is running, we throttle the inserts to around 3500 inserts per second, so that the TempIndex accumulates under 30M newly inserted points in one merge cycle. Since the insertion latencies into in-memory FreshVamana indices is around 1ms (Figure 6), we allocated a total of 3 threads concurrently feeding into the system. This ensured that the system never backlogged throughout the ramp-up experiment.',\n",
       " 'In the steady-state experiment where the index maintains a constant size of about 800M points and is updated in cycles of equal sized insertions and deletions of 30M points, the StreamingMerge procedure takes about 16277 seconds as it has to process deletes in addition to the inserts. Hence, in order to ensure that the system does not get backlogged, we throttled the insertion throughput to around 1800 inserts per second (and similarly for deletes). We achieved this by using two threads for the insertions, and one thread (with a sleep timer) for deletes to match the insertion throughput.',\n",
       " 'Trade-off of Varying Number of Merge Threads T. If we increase the merge threads T, the merges happen faster, which means we can ingest insertions and deletions into the system at a faster throughput (without the TempIndex size growing too large). On the other hand, if T is large, the SSD- bandwidth used by the StreamingMerge process increases and this adversely affects the search throughput. We examine the merge times with varying threads in Figure 7 (left) and the search latencies when different numbers of threads are performing background merge in Figure 8.',\n",
       " '1/0 Cost of Search. Running search with candidate list size L, = 100 gives us the desired steady-state recall in these experiments.

Fur- ther, StreamingMerge scales near linearly with the number of threads (see Figure 7). While the Delete phase scales lin- early, the Patch and Insert phases scale sub-linearly due to intensive SSD I/O. Using fewer threads also results in more predictable search latencies (esp. 99% latency) due to the reduced SSD contention. This allows us to set the number of threads StreamingMerge uses to meet the desired update rate — 3600 updates/sec require 40 threads, but if we were only required to support 1000 updates/sec, we could choose to run StreamingMerge with 10 threads, and take advantage of higher search throughput and predictable latencies.',\n",

Using up- date rules from FreshVamana, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge procedure which reflects these updates into an SSD-resident index with minimal write amplification. Using FreshVamana and StreamingMerge, we develop and rigorously evaluate FreshDiskANN, a highly-scalable fresh- ANNS system that can maintain a dynamic index of a billion points on a commodity machine while concurrently support- ing inserts, deletes, and search operations at millisecond- scale latencies.',\n",

For each such point p, Algorithm 4 applies the pruning process on the candidate list consisting of the undeleted neighbors of p and the undeleted neighbors of the deleted neighbors of p to select the best R points from to its updated neighborhood. In order to perform an average-case analysis, let us assume that the delete set D is a randomly chosen set from the active points P, and suppose |P| = N and PI = B. The expected size of the candidate list will be R(1 — B) + R’B(1 — B). Here the first term accounts for undeleted neighbors of p and the second term accounts for undeleted neighbors of deleted neighbors of p. The expected number of undeleted points in the index is N(1 — ). Therefore the total number of expected operations in the delete phase will be proportional to NR(1— f)? (1 + Rf). This assumes that the complexity of the prune procedure is linear in the size of the candidate list which we validated empirically below.

The quality of an ANN algorithm is judged by the trade-off it provides between accuracy and the hardware resources such as compute, memory and I/O consumed for the search.',\n",
       " 'Even though this abstraction of ANN search is widely studied, it does not capture many important real-world scenarios where user interactions with a system creates and destroys data, and results in updates to P (especially in the literature on graph-based ANNS indices [58]). For example, consider an enterprise-search scenario where the system indexes sentences in documents generated by users across an enterprise. Changes to sentences in a document would correspond to a set of new points inserted and previous points deleted. Another scenario is an email server where arrival and deletion of emails correspond to insertion and deletion of points into an ANNS index. ANNS systems for such applications would need to host indices containing trillions of points with real-time updates that can reflect changes to the corpus in user searches, ideally in real-time.',\n",

Indeed, the current state-of-art system for fresh-ANNS which can support comparable update and search performance on a billion-point dataset is based on the classical LSH algorithm [54], and requires a hundred machines of 32GB RAM (translating to around 25 machines of our stated configuration). In this work, we seek to reduce this deployment cost down to a single machine per billion points. To handle trillion-point indices (as in web-search scenarios), one can employ a simple distributed approach wherein thousand machines host a billion points each — queries are broadcast and results aggregates while updates are routed to the appropriate nodes.',\n",

However, these algorithms suffer from either being too memory intensive, needing to store hundreds of hash functions in main memory, or become extremely slow for query processing when the index is stored on secondary storage. For example, the state-of-art system for streaming similarity search (or fresh-ANNS), PLSH [54], is a parallel and distributed LSH-based mechanism. While it offers comparable update throughput and search performance as our system, it ends up needing 25X more machines due to the high RAM consumption. A similar issue can be seen with',\n",

Alternately, disk-based LSH indices such as SRS [53] can host a billion-point index on a single machine, but the query latencies are extremely slow with the system fetching around 15% of the total index (running into GBs per query) from the disk to provide good accuracy. Another recent algorithm HD-Index [5] can serve a billion-point index with just a few megabytes of RAM footprint, but it suffers from search latencies of a few seconds to get accuracy of around 30%. Moreover, the algorithm only handles insertions, and simply performs a variant of blacklisting for deletions, and hence would need periodic rebuilding. Finally, there are other classes of ANNS algorithms such as kd-Tree [14], Cover Trees [17] which support reasonably efficient update policies, but these algorithms work well only when the data dimensionality is moderately small (under 20); their performance drops when the data dimensionality is 100 or more which is typical for points generated by deep-learning models..',\n",

These algorithms are also widely used in the industry at scale.

So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billionpoint index. This is apart from the cost of actually serving the indices, which would again be anywhere between one for DRAM-SSD hybrid indices [51] to four for in-memory indices [47] depending on the exact algorithm being deployed. This paper aims to serve and update an index over a billion points with real-time freshness using just one machine. This represents a significant cost advantage for web and enterprise-scale search platforms that need to serve indices spanning trillions of points.',\n",

The StreamingMerge procedure with 40 threads takes around 16000 seconds to merge 30M inserts and deletes into a 800M point LTI (a 7.5% change), which is 8.5% of the ~ 190000 seconds it would take to rebuild the index from scratch with a similar thread-count. We conclude that the merge process is significantly more',\n",
       " 'cost-effective than periodically rebuilding the indices, which is the current choice of system design for graph indices. Further, StreamingMerge scales near linearly with the number of threads (see Figure 7). While the Delete phase scales linearly, the Patch and Insert phases scale sub-linearly due to intensive SSD I/O. Using fewer threads also results in more predictable search latencies (esp. 99% latency) due to the reduced SSD contention. This allows us to set the number of threads StreamingMerge uses to meet the desired update rate — 3600 updates/sec require 40 threads, but if we were only required to support 1000 updates/sec, we could choose to run StreamingMerge with 10 threads, and take advantage of higher search throughput and predictable latencies.',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we develop FreshVamana, the first graphbased fresh-ANNS algorithm capable of reflecting updates to an existing index using compute proportional to the size of updates, while ensuring the index quality is similar to one rebuilt from scratch on the updated dataset. Using update rules from FreshVamana, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge procedure which reflects these updates into an SSD-resident index with minimal write amplification. Using FreshVamana and StreamingMerge, we develop and rigorously evaluate FreshDiskANN, a highly-scalable freshANNS system that can maintain a dynamic index of a billion points on a commodity machine while concurrently supporting inserts, deletes, and search operations at millisecondscale latencies.',\n",

Recent advances  in graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity machine with an SSD.',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search performance. Using update tules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes and searches per second each, while retaining > 95% 5-recall@5. This represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices when compared to existing methods.',\n",

The goal is to design a data structure that, given a target k and a query point q, efficiently retrieves the k closest neighbors for q in the dataset P according to the given distance function. This fundamental problem is well studied in the research community  and is a critical component for diverse applications in computer vision , data mining , information retrieval , classification , and recommendation systems , to name a few. As advances in deep learning have made embeddingbased approaches the state-of-the-art in these applications, there has been renewed interest in the problem at scale. Several open-source inverted-index based search engines now support NNS , and new search engines based on',\n",
       " 'Since it is impossible to retrieve the exact nearest neighbors without a cost linear in the size of the dataset in the general case (see ) due to a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality , one aims to find the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) where the goal is to retrieve k neighbors that are close to being optimal. The quality of an ANN algorithm is judged by the trade-off it provides between accuracy and the hardware resources such as compute, memory and I/O consumed for the search.',\n",
       " 'Even though this abstraction of ANN search is widely studied, it does not capture many important real-world scenarios where user interactions with a system creates and destroys data, and results in updates to P (especially in the literature on graph-based ANNS indices ). For example, consider an enterprise-search scenario where the system indexes sentences in documents generated by users across an enterprise. Changes to sentences in a document would correspond to a set of new points inserted and previous points deleted. Another scenario is an email server where arrival and deletion of emails correspond to insertion and deletion of points into an ANNS index. ANNS systems for such applications would need to host indices containing trillions of points with real-time updates that can reflect changes to the corpus in user searches, ideally in real-time.',\n",
       " 'Motivated by such scenarios, we are interested in solving the fresh-ANNS problem, where the goal is to support ANNS on a continually changing set of points. Formally, we define the fresh-ANNS problem thus: given a time varying dataset P (with state P; at time t), the goal is to maintain a dynamic index that computes the approximate nearest neighbors for any query q issued at time t only on the active dataset P;. Such a system must support three operations (a) insert a new point, (b) delete an existing point, and (c) search for the nearest neighbors given a query point. The overall quality of a fresh-ANNS system is measured by:',\n",
       " 'Goal. Motivated by real-world scenarios, we seek to build the most cost-effective system for the fresh-ANNS problem which can maintain a billion-point index using commodity machines with 128GB RAM and a 2TB SSD? and support thousands of real-time inserts and deletes per second, and also thousands of searches per second with high accuracy of 95+% 5-recall@5. Indeed, the current state-of-art system for fresh-ANNS which can support comparable update and search performance on a billion-point dataset is based on the classical LSH algorithm , and requires a hundred machines of 32GB RAM (translating to around 25 machines of our stated configuration). In this work, we seek to reduce this deployment cost down to a single machine per billion points. To handle trillion-point indices (as in web-search scenarios), one can employ a simple distributed approach wherein thousand machines host a billion points each — queries are broadcast and results aggregates while updates are routed to the appropriate nodes.',\n",
       " 'Of all the algorithms for static-ANNS, the ones most easily capable of supporting streaming support are the ones based on simple hashing algorithms such as LSH (locality sensitive hashing). However, these algorithms suffer from either being too memory intensive, needing to store hundreds of hash functions in main memory, or become extremely slow for query processing when the index is stored on secondary storage. For example, the state-of-art system for streaming similarity search (or fresh-ANNS), PLSH , is a parallel and distributed LSH-based mechanism. While it offers comparable update throughput and search performance as our system, it ends up needing 25X more machines due to the high RAM consumption. A similar issue can be seen with',\n",
       " 'PM-LSH, another state-of-art system based on LSH , where the memory footprint is a bit lower than PLSH (due to the system using fewer LSH tables), but the query latencies are an order of magnitude slower than our system and PLSH. Alternately, disk-based LSH indices such as SRS  can host a billion-point index on a single machine, but the query latencies are extremely slow with the system fetching around 15% of the total index (running into GBs per query) from the disk to provide good accuracy. Another recent algorithm HD-Index  can serve a billion-point index with just a few megabytes of RAM footprint, but it suffers from search latencies of a few seconds to get accuracy of around 30%. Moreover, the algorithm only handles insertions, and simply performs a variant of blacklisting for deletions, and hence would need periodic rebuilding. Finally, there are other classes of ANNS algorithms such as kd-Tree , Cover Trees  which support reasonably efficient update policies, but these algorithms work well only when the data dimensionality is moderately small (under 20); their performance drops when the data dimensionality is 100 or more which is typical for points generated by deep-learning models..',\n",
       " 'At the other end of the spectrum of ANNS indices are graph-based indexing algorithms . Several comparative studies  of ANNS algorithms have concluded that they significantly out-perform other techniques in terms of search throughput on a range of realworld static datasets. These algorithms are also widely used in the industry at scale. However, all known graph indices are static and do not support updates, especially delete requests , possibly due to the fact that simple graph modification rules for insertions and deletions do not retain the same graph quality over a stream of insertions and deletions.',\n",
       " 'As a result, the current practice in industry is to periodically re-build such indices from scratch  to manifest recent changes to the underlying dataset. However, this is a very expensive operation. It would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good quality HNSW index  over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billionpoint index. This is apart from the cost of actually serving the indices, which would again be anywhere between one for DRAM-SSD hybrid indices  to four for in-memory indices  depending on the exact algorithm being deployed. This paper aims to serve and update an index over a billion points with real-time freshness using just one machine. This represents a significant cost advantage for web and enterprise-scale search platforms that need to serve indices spanning trillions of points.',\n",

       " '3. In order to enable scale, our system stores the bulk of the graph-index on an SSD, with only the most recent updates stored in memory. To support this, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge algorithm which makes merges the in-memory index with the SSD-index in a very write-efficient manner (crucial since burdening the SSD would lead to worse search performance as well). Notably, the time and space complexity of the merge procedure is proportional to the change set, thereby making it possible to update large billion-point indices on a machine with limited RAM using an order of magnitude less compute and memory than re-building the large index from scratch.',\n",

Using these ideas, we design the FreshDiskANN system to consist of a long-term SSD-resident index over the majority of the points, and a short-term in-memory index to aggregate recent updates. Periodically, unbeknownst to the end user, FreshDiskANN consolidates the short-term index into the long-term index using our StreamingMerge process in the background to bound the memory footprint of the short-term index, and hence the overall system.',\n",

For such points, spatial partitioning ideas such as R*-trees , kd-trees  and Cover Trees  work well, but these typically do not scale well for high-dimensional data owing to the curse of dimensionality. There have been some recent advances in maintaining several trees and combining them with new ideas to develop good algorithms such as FLANN  and Annoy . However, they are built for static indices, and moreover, even here, the graph-based algorithms outperform them  on most datasets.',\n",
       " 'Hashing. In a breakthrough result, Indyk and Motwani  show that a class of algorithms, known as locality sensitive hashing can yield provably approximate solutions to the ANNS problem with a polynomially-sized index and sublinear query time. Subsequent to this work, there has been a plethora of different LSH-based algorithms , including those which depend on the data , use spectral methods , distributed LSH , etc. While the advantage of the simpler data-independent hashing methods are that updates are almost trivial, the indices are often entirely resident in DRAM and hence do not scale very well. Implementations which make use of auxiliary storage such as SRS  typically have several orders of magnitude slower query latencies compared to the graph-based algorithms. Other hashing-based methods  learn an optimal hash family by exploiting the neighborhood graph. Updates to an index would require a full re-computation of the family and hashes for every database point, making them impractical for fresh-ANNS.',\n",

Some of these systems such as FAISS  support insert and delete operations on an existing index under reasonable conditions like stationary data distributions. However, due to the irreversible loss due to the compression/quantization, these methods fail to achieve even moderate values of 1-recall@1, sometimes plateauing at 50% recall. These methods offer good guarantees on weaker notions such as 1-recall@100, which is the likelihood that the true nearest neighbor for a query appears in a list of 100 candidates output by the algorithm. Hence they are not the methods of choice for high-recall high-throughput scenarios.',\n",

New points are inserted into an in-memory HNSW  index while the main on-disk index utilises a new PQ-based indexing algorithm called VGPQ. In order to mitigate the accuracy loss due to PQ, VGPQ search performs a large number of distance computations and incurs high search latencies. As distributed system over several powerful nodes, the model has low search throughput even when no inserts and deletes are going on. Hence, such a system cannot be used in high-throughput scenarios.',\n",

       " 'Roughly speaking, navigability of a directed graph is the property that ensures that the index can be queried for nearest neighbors using a greedy search algorithm. The greedy search algorithm traverses the graph starting at a designated navigating or start node s € P. The search iterates by greedily walking from the current node u to a node v € Nout(u) that minimizes the distance to the query, and terminates when it reaches a locally-optimal node, say p*, that has the property d(p*,q) < d(p,q) Vp € Nou(p*). Greedy search cannot improve distance to the query point by navigating out of p* and returns it as the candidate nearest neighbor for query q. Algorithm 1 describes a variant of this greedy search algorithm that returns k nearest neighbor candidates. Index Build consists of constructing a navigable graph. The graph is typically built to achieve two contrasting objectives to minimize search complexity: (i) make the greedy search algorithm applied to each base point p € P in the vertex set converge to p in the fewest iterations (intuitively, this would ensure that Algorithm 1 converges to p when searching for a query Xq if p is the nearest-neighbor for xq), and (ii) have a maximum out-degree of at most R for all p € P, a parameter typically between 16 — 128.',\n",

Arguably, this is due to the lack of methods which modify the navigable graphs while retaining the original search quality. To further examine this phenomenon, we considered three popular static-ANNS algorithms, namely HNSW, NSG, and Vamana and tried the following natural update policies when faced with insertions and deletions.',\n",

While FreshDiskANN provides latencies of about 1ms for insert (Figure 6) and 0.1: for delete (since they are simply added to a DeleteList), in practice they need to be throttled so that the in-memory TempIndex do not grow too large before the ongoing background merge completes. As a result, the speed of the merge operation dictates the update rates the system can sustain over long periods of time. The threads allocation described above helps us control the rate of external insert and delete operations to what the StreamingMerge procedure can complete before the TempIndex grows to 30M points.',\n",
       " 'To better understand the thread allocation, we record the time taken for the StreamingMerge process to merge 30M inserts into an index of size roughly 800M using T = 40 threads. This takes around 8400s per cycle. To prevent the TempIndex from growing too much while the merge procedure is running, we throttle the inserts to around 3500 inserts per second, so that the TempIndex accumulates under 30M newly inserted points in one merge cycle. Since the insertion latencies into in-memory FreshVamana indices is around 1ms (Figure 6), we allocated a total of 3 threads concurrently feeding into the system. This ensured that the system never backlogged throughout the ramp-up experiment.',\n",

If we increase the merge threads T, the merges happen faster, which means we can ingest insertions and deletions into the system at a faster throughput (without the TempIndex size growing too large). On the other hand, if T is large, the SSDbandwidth used by the StreamingMerge process increases and this adversely affects the search throughput. We examine the merge times with varying threads in Figure 7 (left) and the search latencies when different numbers of threads are performing background merge in Figure 8.',\n",

Using fewer threads also results in more predictable search latencies (esp. 99% latency) due to the reduced SSD contention. This allows us to set the number of threads StreamingMerge uses to meet the desired update rate — 3600 updates/sec require 40 threads, but if we were only required to support 1000 updates/sec, we could choose to run StreamingMerge with 10 threads, and take advantage of higher search throughput and predictable latencies.',\n",

       "{'freshdisk': 'Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental building block in information retrieval with graphbased indices being the current state-of-the-art  and widely used in the industry. Recent advances  in graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity machine with an SSD. In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search performance. Using update tules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes and searches per second each, while retaining > 95% 5-recall@5. This represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices when compared to existing methods. In the Nearest Neighbor Search problem, we are given a dataset P of points along with a pairwise distance function. The goal is to design a data structure that, given a target k and a query point q, efficiently retrieves the k closest neighbors for q in the dataset P according to the given distance function. This fundamental problem is well studied in the research community  and is a critical component for diverse applications in computer vision , data mining , information retrieval , classification , and recommendation systems , to name a few. As advances in deep learning have made embeddingbased approaches the state-of-the-art in these applications, there has been renewed interest in the problem at scale. Several open-source inverted-index based search engines now support NNS , and new search engines based on Since it is impossible to retrieve the exact nearest neighbors without a cost linear in the size of the dataset in the general case (see ) due to a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality , one aims to find the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) where the goal is to retrieve k neighbors that are close to being optimal. The quality of an ANN algorithm is judged by the trade-off it provides between accuracy and the hardware resources such as compute, memory and I/O consumed for the search. Even though this abstraction of ANN search is widely studied, it does not capture many important real-world scenarios where user interactions with a system creates and destroys data, and results in updates to P (especially in the literature on graph-based ANNS indices ). For example, consider an enterprise-search scenario where the system indexes sentences in documents generated by users across an enterprise. Changes to sentences in a document would correspond to a set of new points inserted and previous points deleted. Another scenario is an email server where arrival and deletion of emails correspond to insertion and deletion of points into an ANNS index. ANNS systems for such applications would need to host indices containing trillions of points with real-time updates that can reflect changes to the corpus in user searches, ideally in real-time. Motivated by such scenarios, we are interested in solving the fresh-ANNS problem, where the goal is to support ANNS on a continually changing set of points. Formally, we define the fresh-ANNS problem thus: given a time varying dataset P (with state P; at time t), the goal is to maintain a dynamic index that computes the approximate nearest neighbors for any query q issued at time t only on the active dataset P;. Such a system must support three operations (a) insert a new point, (b) delete an existing point, and (c) search for the nearest neighbors given a query point. The overall quality of a fresh-ANNS system is measured by: Goal. Motivated by real-world scenarios, we seek to build the most cost-effective system for the fresh-ANNS problem which can maintain a billion-point index using commodity machines with 128GB RAM and a 2TB SSD? and support thousands of real-time inserts and deletes per second, and also thousands of searches per second with high accuracy of 95+% 5-recall@5. Indeed, the current state-of-art system for fresh-ANNS which can support comparable update and search performance on a billion-point dataset is based on the classical LSH algorithm , and requires a hundred machines of 32GB RAM (translating to around 25 machines of our stated configuration). In this work, we seek to reduce this deployment cost down to a single machine per billion points. To handle trillion-point indices (as in web-search scenarios), one can employ a simple distributed approach wherein thousand machines host a billion points each — queries are broadcast and results aggregates while updates are routed to the appropriate nodes. Of all the algorithms for static-ANNS, the ones most easily capable of supporting streaming support are the ones based on simple hashing algorithms such as LSH (locality sensitive hashing). However, these algorithms suffer from either being too memory intensive, needing to store hundreds of hash functions in main memory, or become extremely slow for query processing when the index is stored on secondary storage. For example, the state-of-art system for streaming similarity search (or fresh-ANNS), PLSH , is a parallel and distributed LSH-based mechanism. While it offers comparable update throughput and search performance as our system, it ends up needing 25X more machines due to the high RAM consumption. A similar issue can be seen with PM-LSH, another state-of-art system based on LSH , where the memory footprint is a bit lower than PLSH (due to the system using fewer LSH tables), but the query latencies are an order of magnitude slower than our system and PLSH. Alternately, disk-based LSH indices such as SRS  can host a billion-point index on a single machine, but the query latencies are extremely slow with the system fetching around 15% of the total index (running into GBs per query) from the disk to provide good accuracy. Another recent algorithm HD-Index  can serve a billion-point index with just a few megabytes of RAM footprint, but it suffers from search latencies of a few seconds to get accuracy of around 30%. Moreover, the algorithm only handles insertions, and simply performs a variant of blacklisting for deletions, and hence would need periodic rebuilding. Finally, there are other classes of ANNS algorithms such as kd-Tree , Cover Trees  which support reasonably efficient update policies, but these algorithms work well only when the data dimensionality is moderately small (under 20); their performance drops when the data dimensionality is 100 or more which is typical for points generated by deep-learning models.. At the other end of the spectrum of ANNS indices are graph-based indexing algorithms . Several comparative studies  of ANNS algorithms have concluded that they significantly out-perform other techniques in terms of search throughput on a range of realworld static datasets. These algorithms are also widely used in the industry at scale. However, all known graph indices are static and do not support updates, especially delete requests , possibly due to the fact that simple graph modification rules for insertions and deletions do not retain the same graph quality over a stream of insertions and deletions. As a result, the current practice in industry is to periodically re-build such indices from scratch  to manifest recent changes to the underlying dataset. However, this is a very expensive operation. It would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good quality HNSW index  over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billionpoint index. This is apart from the cost of actually serving the indices, which would again be anywhere between one for DRAM-SSD hybrid indices  to four for in-memory indices  depending on the exact algorithm being deployed. This paper aims to serve and update an index over a billion points with real-time freshness using just one machine. This represents a significant cost advantage for web and enterprise-scale search platforms that need to serve indices spanning trillions of points. 1. We demonstrate how simple graph update rules result in degradation of index quality over a stream of insertions and deletions for popular graph-based algorithms such as HNSW  and NSG . 3. In order to enable scale, our system stores the bulk of the graph-index on an SSD, with only the most recent updates stored in memory. To support this, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge algorithm which makes merges the in-memory index with the SSD-index in a very write-efficient manner (crucial since burdening the SSD would lead to worse search performance as well). Notably, the time and space complexity of the merge procedure is proportional to the change set, thereby making it possible to update large billion-point indices on a machine with limited RAM using an order of magnitude less compute and memory than re-building the large index from scratch. 4. Using these ideas, we design the FreshDiskANN system to consist of a long-term SSD-resident index over the majority of the points, and a short-term in-memory index to aggregate recent updates. Periodically, unbeknownst to the end user, FreshDiskANN consolidates the short-term index into the long-term index using our StreamingMerge process in the background to bound the memory footprint of the short-term index, and hence the overall system. Trees. Some of the early research on ANNS focused on low-dimensional points (say, d < 20). For such points, spatial partitioning ideas such as R*-trees , kd-trees  and Cover Trees  work well, but these typically do not scale well for high-dimensional data owing to the curse of dimensionality. There have been some recent advances in maintaining several trees and combining them with new ideas to develop good algorithms such as FLANN  and Annoy . However, they are built for static indices, and moreover, even here, the graph-based algorithms outperform them  on most datasets. Hashing. In a breakthrough result, Indyk and Motwani  show that a class of algorithms, known as locality sensitive hashing can yield provably approximate solutions to the ANNS problem with a polynomially-sized index and sublinear query time. Subsequent to this work, there has been a plethora of different LSH-based algorithms , including those which depend on the data , use spectral methods , distributed LSH , etc. While the advantage of the simpler data-independent hashing methods are that updates are almost trivial, the indices are often entirely resident in DRAM and hence do not scale very well. Implementations which make use of auxiliary storage such as SRS  typically have several orders of magnitude slower query latencies compared to the graph-based algorithms. Other hashing-based methods  learn an optimal hash family by exploiting the neighborhood graph. Updates to an index would require a full re-computation of the family and hashes for every database point, making them impractical for fresh-ANNS. Data quantization and Inverted indices based algorithms have seen success w.r.t the goal of scaling to large datasets with low memory footprint. These algorithms effectively reduce the dimensionality of the ANNS problem by quantizing vectors into a compressed representation so that they may be stored using smaller amount of DRAM. Some choices of quantizers  can support GPU-accelerated search on billion-scale datasets. Popular methods like IV- memory-footprint indices with reasonable search performance when querying for a large number of neighbors. While most methods minimize the vector reconstruction error ||x — x‘ ||?, where x is a database vector and x? is its reconstruction from the quantized representation, Anisotropic Vector Quantization  optimizes for error for maximum inner-product search. Some of these systems such as FAISS  support insert and delete operations on an existing index under reasonable conditions like stationary data distributions. However, due to the irreversible loss due to the compression/quantization, these methods fail to achieve even moderate values of 1-recall@1, sometimes plateauing at 50% recall. These methods offer good guarantees on weaker notions such as 1-recall@100, which is the likelihood that the true nearest neighbor for a query appears in a list of 100 candidates output by the algorithm. Hence they are not the methods of choice for high-recall high-throughput scenarios. A recent work, ADBV , proposes a hybrid model for supporting streaming inserts and deletes. New points are inserted into an in-memory HNSW  index while the main on-disk index utilises a new PQ-based indexing algorithm called VGPQ. In order to mitigate the accuracy loss due to PQ, VGPQ search performs a large number of distance computations and incurs high search latencies. As distributed system over several powerful nodes, the model has low search throughput even when no inserts and deletes are going on. Hence, such a system cannot be used in high-throughput scenarios. In this section, we recap how most state-of-the-art graphbased indices work for static-ANNS and also highlight the issues they face with supporting deletions. graph, we let Nout(p) and Nin(p) denote the set of outand in-edges of p. We denote the number of points by n = |P|. Finally, we let xp denote the database vector corresponding to p, and let d(p, q) = ||xp — Xq|| denote the f distance between two points p and q. We now describe how graph-based ANNS indices are built and used for search. Roughly speaking, navigability of a directed graph is the property that ensures that the index can be queried for nearest neighbors using a greedy search algorithm. The greedy search algorithm traverses the graph starting at a designated navigating or start node s € P. The search iterates by greedily walking from the current node u to a node v € Nout(u) that minimizes the distance to the query, and terminates when it reaches a locally-optimal node, say p*, that has the property d(p*,q) < d(p,q) Vp € Nou(p*). Greedy search cannot improve distance to the query point by navigating out of p* and returns it as the candidate nearest neighbor for query q. Algorithm 1 describes a variant of this greedy search algorithm that returns k nearest neighbor candidates. Index Build consists of constructing a navigable graph. The graph is typically built to achieve two contrasting objectives to minimize search complexity: (i) make the greedy search algorithm applied to each base point p € P in the vertex set converge to p in the fewest iterations (intuitively, this would ensure that Algorithm 1 converges to p when searching for a query Xq if p is the nearest-neighbor for xq), and (ii) have a maximum out-degree of at most R for all p € P, a parameter typically between 16 — 128. While graph-indices offer state-of-the-art search performance, all known algorithms apply for the static-ANNS problem. In particular, deletions pose a big challenge for all these algorithms — e.g., see this discussion  on HNSW supporting delete requests by adding them to a blacklist and omitting from search results. Arguably, this is due to the lack of methods which modify the navigable graphs while retaining the original search quality. To further examine this phenomenon, we considered three popular static-ANNS algorithms, namely HNSW, NSG, and Vamana and tried the following natural update policies when faced with insertions and deletions. Insertion Policy. For insertion of a new point p, we run the candidate generation algorithm as used by the respective algorithms and add the chosen inand out-edges, and if necessary, whenever the degree of any vertex exceeds the budget, run the corresponding pruning procedure. Delete Policy A. When a point p is deleted, we simply remove all inand out-edges incident to p, without adding any newer edges to compensate for potential loss of navigability. Indeed, note that p might have been on several navigating paths to other points in the graph. Delete Policy B. When a point p is deleted, we remove all inand out-edges incident to p, and add edges in the local neighborhood of p as follows: for any pair of directed edges (pin, p) and (p, Pout) in the graph, add the edge (pin, Pout) in the updated graph. If the degree bound of any vertex is violated, we run the pruning procedure associated with the respective algorithm to control the degrees. Figure 1 shows that both of these delete policies are not effective. In this experiment, we consider the SIFT1M dataset  comprising of a million points in 128 dimensions, and start with the static-ANNS index for each of the algorithms. We then compose an update stream by selecting 5% of the points at random and deleting them, followed by presenting them again as insertions. We then repeat this process over multiple Figure 1. Search recall over 20 cycles of deleting and reinserting 5% of SIFT1M dataset with statically built HNSW, Vamana, and NSG indices with L; = 44, 20, 27, respectively. A new point x, is inserted into a FreshVamana index using Algorithm 2. Intuitively, it queries the current index for nearest neighbors of p to obtain the visited set V, generates candidate out-neighbors for xp using pruning procedure in Algorithm 3 on VV, and adds bi-directed edges between p and the pruned candidates. If out-degree of any vertex exceeds R, Algorithm 3 can be used to prune it to R. Our deletion algorithm Algorithm 4 is along the lines of Delete Policy B in Section 3.3, with the crucial feature being using the relaxed a-pruning algorithm to retain density of the modified graph. Specifically, if p is deleted, we add edges (p’,p’’) whenever (p’, p) and (p, p’”) are directed edges in the current graph. In this process, if |Nout(p’)| exceeds the maximum out-degree R, we prune it using Algorithm 3, preserving the a—RNG property. However, since this operation involves editing the neighborhood for all the in-neighbors of p, it could result be expensive to do eagerly, i.e., processing deletes as they arrive. FreshVamana employs a lazy deletion strategy when a point p is deleted, we add p to a DeleteList without changing the graph. DeleteList contains all the points that have been deleted but are still present in the graph. At search time, a modified Algorithm 1 uses nodes in the DeleteList for navigation, but filters them out from the result set. Delete Consolidation. After accumulating a non-trivial number of deletions (say 1-10% of the the index size), we batch-update the graph using Algorithm 4 to update the neighborhoods of points with out-edges to these deleted nodes. This operation is trivially parallelized using prefix sums to consolidate the vertex list, and a parallel map operation to locally update the graph around the deleted nodes. We now demonstrate how using our insert and delete algorithms (along with a choice of a > 1) ensures that the resulting index is stable over a long stream of updates. 5% Index Size 10% Index Size 50% Index Size 100 100 100 3 99 99 7 99 | ——  SIFTIM © 98 98 | | 98 4 ——  DeepiM a 97 97|| 97 4 2 96 96 96 by Sydieoeatd ——  GISTIM fe 95 95 Saeeeoceaell 95 “ah —— SIFT100M 94 94 ; ; 94 ; ; 0 20 40 20 40 Cycles Cycles SIFT1M Deep1M 98 to ® 96 ‘Ss 94 # ite) 92 90 20 40 0 20 40 Cycles (5% index size) a=1 a=1.1 a=1.2 a=13 scale to a billion-points per machine due to the large memory footprint of storing the graph and data in RAM. The main idea of overall system FreshDiskANN is to store a bulk of the graph-index on an SSD, and store only the recent changes in RAMTo further reduce the memory footprint, we can simply store compressed vector representation (using an idea such as Product Quantization (PQ) ) of all the data vectors. In fact, these ideas of using a-RNG graphs and storing only compressed vectors formed the crux of the SSD-based DiskANN static-ANNS index . 3.As FreshVamana graphs are constructed using the a-RNG property (Section 4), the number of steps that the greedy search algorithm takes to converge to a locally optima is much smaller than other graph algorithms. Hence the total search latency to fetch the graph neighborhoods from SSD is small. So the a-RNG property helps us with both ensuring recall stability as well as obtaining tolerable search latencies for SSD-based indices. The overall system maintains two types of indices: one LongTerm Index (aka LTI) and one or more instances of Temporary Index (a.k.a TempIndex), along with a DeleteList. ROand RW-Templndex: To aid with crash recovery, FreshDiskANN uses two types of TempIndex. At all times, (called RW-TempIndex) which can accept insert requests. We periodically convert the RW-TempIndex into a read-only in-memory index called RO-TempIndex, and also snapshot it to persistent storage. We then create a new empty RWTemp!ndex to ingest new points. Finally, to complete the system design, we now present details of the StreamingMerge procedure. Whenever the total memory footprint of the various RO-TempIndex exceeds a pre-specified threshold, the system invokes a background merge procedure serves to change the SSD-resident LTI to reflect the inserts from the various instances of the ROTempIndex and also the deletes from the DeleteList. To this end, for notational convenience, let dataset P reflect the points in the LTI, and N denote points currently staged in the different RO-TempIndex instances, and D denote the points marked for deletion in DeleteList. Then the desired end-result of the StreamingMerge is an SSD-resident LTI over the dataset (P U N) \\\\ D. Following the successful completion of the merge process, the system clears out the ROTempIndex instances thereby keeping the total memory footprint under control. There are two important constraints that the procedure must follow: At a high level, StreamingMerge first runs Algorithm 4 to process the deletes from D to obtain an intermediate-LTI index over the points P\\\\ D. Then StreamingMerge runs Algorithm 2 to insert each of the points in N into the intermediateLTI to obtain the resultant LTI. However, Algorithms 2 and 4 assume that both the LTI graph, as well as the full-precision vectors all the datapoints are stored in memory. The crucial challenges in StreamingMerge is to simulate these algorithm invocations in a memory and SSD-efficient manner. This is done in three phases outlined below. 1. Delete Phase: This phase works on the input LTI instance and produces an intermediate-LT| by running Algorithm 4 to process the deletions D. To do this in a memoryefficient manner, we load the points in LTI and their neighborhoods in the LT! block-by-block from the SSD, and execute Algorithm 4 for the nodes in the block using multiple threads, and write the modified block back to SSD on the intermediate-LTI. Furthermore, whenever Algorithm 4 or Algorithm 3 make any distance comparisons, we use the compressed PQ vectors which are already stored on behalf of the LTI to calculate the approximate distances. Note that this idea of replacing any exact distance computations with approximate distances using the compressed vectors will be used in the subsequent phases of the StreamingMerge also. 2. Insert Phase: This phase adds all the new points in N to the intermediate-LTI by trying to simulate Algorithm 2. As a first step, we run the GreedySearch(s, p, 1, L) on the SSDresident intermediate-LTI to get the set V of vertices visited on the search path. Since the graph is stored on the SSD, any requested neighborhood Nou(p’) by the search algorithm is fetched from the SSD. The a-RNG property ensures that the number of such neighborhood requests is small, and hence the overall latency per point is bounded. We then run the RobustPrune(p, V, a, R) procedure to determine the candidate set of neighbors for p. However, unlike Algorithm 2, we do not immediately attempt to insert p into Nour(p’) for P’ © Nout(p) (the backward edges) since this could result in an impractical number of random reads and writes to 3. Patch Phase: After processing all the inserts, we patch the A data-structure into the output SSD-resident LTI index. For this, we fetch all points p in the intermediate-LTI blockby-block from the SSD, add the relevant out-edges for each node p from A, and check the new degree | Nou (p) UA(p)| exceeds R. If so, prune the neighborhood by setting Nour(p) = RobustPrune(p, Nour (p) U A(p), «, +). Within each block read from the SSD, this operation can be applied to each vertex in a data-parallel manner. Subsequently, the updated block is written back to SSD before loading a new block. 1/0 cost. The procedure does exactly two sequential passes over the SSD-resident data structure in the Delete and Patch Phases. Due to the a-RNG property of the intermediateLTI, the insertion algorithm performs a small number of random 4KB reads per inserted point (about 100 disk reads, a little more than the candidate list size parameter, which we typically set to 75). Note that this number would be much larger without the a-RNG property due to the possibility of very long navigation paths. Memory footprint: Throughout the StreamingMerge process, A data structure has size O(|N|R) where R is the max-degree parameter of the index which is typically a small constant. For example, if |N| = 30M and R = 64, this footprint will be ~7GB. In addition, for approximate distances, recall that we keep a copy of PQ coordinates for all points in the index (~ 32GB for a billion-point index). While we have already demonstrated that our update algorithms Algorithms 2 and 4 ensure recall stability over long streams of updates in Section 4.3, the actual form in which these algorithms are implemented in our StreamingMerge procedure is different, especially with the use of approximate compressed vectors for distance computations. Indeed, as we process more cycles of the StreamingMerge procedure, we expect the initial graph to be replaced by a graph entirely built based on approximate distances. Hence, we expect a In the experiment in Figure 4, we start with a statically built SSD-index built on 80M points randomly sampled from the SIFT100M dataset. Then, in each cycle, we update the index to reflect 8M deletions and an equal number of insertions from the spare pool of 20M points using StreamingMerge. We run this experiment for a total of 40 cycles and trace recall for the index after each cycle in Figure 4. Note that the index stabilizes at a lower recall value compared to the static index it starts out with, due to the use of approximate distances in the StreamingMerge process. We observe recall stabilization after ~ 20 cycles of deletion and insertion of 10% of the index size, at which point we expect most of the graph to be determined using approximate distances. Figure 4 (right) shows a similar plot for the 800M point subset of SIFT1B. We have thus empirically demonstrated that the FreshDiskANN index has stable recall over a stream of updates at steady-state. The frequency at which RW-TempIndex is snapshotted to a RO-TempIndex depends on the intended recovery time. More frequent snapshots lead to small reconstruction times for RWTempIndex but create many instances of RO-TempIndex all of which have to be searched for each query. While searching a few additional small in-memory indices is not the rate limiting step for answering the query (searching the large LTI is), creating too many could can lead to inefficient search. A typical set up for a billion-point index would hold up to 30M points in the TempIndex between merges to the LTI. Limiting each in-memory index to 5M points results in at 6.1 Experimental Setup Hardware. All experiments are run on one of two machines: e (mem-mc) — a 64-vcore E64d_v4 Azure virtual machine instance used to measure latencies and recall for inmemory indices and the FreshVamana update rules. e (ssd-mc) — a bare-metal server with 2x Xeon 8160 CPUs (48 cores, 96 threads) and a 3.2TB Samsung PM1725a PCle SSD to evaluate SSD-based indices and the overall FreshDiskANN system. We now study the complete FreshDiskANN system in a realistic scenario — maintaining a large scale billion-scale index on the ssd machine and serving thousands of inserts, deletes and searches per second concurrently over multiple days. For this experiment, we use the SIFT1B dataset, but limit the size of our indices to around 800M points, so that we have a sufficiently big spare pool of 200M points for insertions at all times. Our experiment can be divided into two phases: in the first phase, starting with a statically built index on a random 100M subset of SIFT1B, we define our update stream to comprise only of inserts until the total number of points in the index reaches around 800M points. We call this the ramp-up phase. We then transition into what we call a steady-state phase, where we update the index by deleting and inserting points at the same rate. We delete existing points and insert points from the spare pool of 200M points from the SIFT1B dataset. We then continue this for several days and observe the behaviour of the system in terms of latencies and recall. How fast can we feed inserts into the system in these phases, i.e., how many threads can we use to concurrently insert into the FreshDiskANN system? If we use too many threads for insertion, the TempIndex will reach the limit M of 30M points before the StreamingMerge process has completed. This would result in a backlog of inserts not consolidate to LT] on SSD. With the benefit of some prior experiments (of how long each cycle of the StreamingMerge takes), we arrive at the number of threads which concurrently feed inserts into the FreshDiskANN system in each of the phases and describe them below. Figure 5. Search latencies for Ls = 100 (always > 92% 5recall@5) over the course of ramping up an index to size 800M. Each point is mean latency over a 10000-query batch. Stage 2: Steady State. In the second stage of the experiment, we maintain an index size of around 800M while supporting a large number of equal inserts and deletes. Externally, 2 threads insert points into the index, 1 thread issues deletes, and 10 threads concurrently search it. Since the deletes happen near instantly, we added a sleep timer between the delete requests to ensure that the rate of deletions is similar to that of insertions. Note that we reduced the number of insert threads from 3 to 2 to slow down the insertion rate to accommodate the longer merge times compared to the ramp-up experiment — the StreamingMerge process now processes 30M deletes in addition to 30M inserts. We present userperceived latencies for search and insertions in Figure 6. think is likely due to head-of-line blocking by the large sequential read and write operations that copy the LTI index to and from the main memory. Update Throughput of System. While FreshDiskANN provides latencies of about 1ms for insert (Figure 6) and 0.1: for delete (since they are simply added to a DeleteList), in practice they need to be throttled so that the in-memory TempIndex do not grow too large before the ongoing background merge completes. As a result, the speed of the merge operation dictates the update rates the system can sustain over long periods of time. The threads allocation described above helps us control the rate of external insert and delete operations to what the StreamingMerge procedure can complete before the TempIndex grows to 30M points. To better understand the thread allocation, we record the time taken for the StreamingMerge process to merge 30M inserts into an index of size roughly 800M using T = 40 threads. This takes around 8400s per cycle. To prevent the TempIndex from growing too much while the merge procedure is running, we throttle the inserts to around 3500 inserts per second, so that the TempIndex accumulates under 30M newly inserted points in one merge cycle. Since the insertion latencies into in-memory FreshVamana indices is around 1ms (Figure 6), we allocated a total of 3 threads concurrently feeding into the system. This ensured that the system never backlogged throughout the ramp-up experiment. Trade-off of Varying Number of Merge Threads T. If we increase the merge threads T, the merges happen faster, which means we can ingest insertions and deletions into the system at a faster throughput (without the TempIndex size growing too large). On the other hand, if T is large, the SSDbandwidth used by the StreamingMerge process increases and this adversely affects the search throughput. We examine the merge times with varying threads in Figure 7 (left) and the search latencies when different numbers of threads are performing background merge in Figure 8. 70 30 1.6 PARAL @ 60 B95 ~ £ 50 & a 1.4} jth Ea > ZS fs 520 = th ——s0 & 40 3 g 1.27 5) £45 5 goth = 30 3 1} = = 19 Sipe] £ 20 9 3 § v 0. 8 = | HB 10 a» 1) eo 1 i 4 0 i | fi Ll Lo Lo 0.6 Ap nneteernne| 0 2-105 4-10° 6-10° 5,000 10,000 15,000 0 10 20 30 40 Time elapsed since start of experiment (seconds) Time since merge start (sec) #Batches Figure 6. Mean latency‘measurements for the week-long steady-state experiment with an 800M FreshDiskANN index The Cost of StreamingMerge. The StreamingMerge procedure with 40 threads takes around 16000 seconds to merge 30M inserts and deletes into a 800M point LTI (a 7.5% change), which is 8.5% of the ~ 190000 seconds it would take to rebuild the index from scratch with a similar thread-count. We conclude that the merge process is significantly more cost-effective than periodically rebuilding the indices, which is the current choice of system design for graph indices. Further, StreamingMerge scales near linearly with the number of threads (see Figure 7). While the Delete phase scales linearly, the Patch and Insert phases scale sub-linearly due to intensive SSD I/O. Using fewer threads also results in more predictable search latencies (esp. 99% latency) due to the reduced SSD contention. This allows us to set the number of threads StreamingMerge uses to meet the desired update rate — 3600 updates/sec require 40 threads, but if we were only required to support 1000 updates/sec, we could choose to run StreamingMerge with 10 threads, and take advantage of higher search throughput and predictable latencies. In this paper, we develop FreshVamana, the first graphbased fresh-ANNS algorithm capable of reflecting updates to an existing index using compute proportional to the size of updates, while ensuring the index quality is similar to one rebuilt from scratch on the updated dataset. Using update rules from FreshVamana, we design a novel two-pass StreamingMerge procedure which reflects these updates into an SSD-resident index with minimal write amplification. Using FreshVamana and StreamingMerge, we develop and rigorously evaluate FreshDiskANN, a highly-scalable freshANNS system that can maintain a dynamic index of a billion points on a commodity machine while concurrently supporting inserts, deletes, and search operations at millisecondscale latencies.

Horizontal lines indicate recall of the Vamana index with the same build time. n Table 1 we compare the build time of Vamana and FreshVamana for the same build parameters. The trade-off for this speed-up comes in the form of increased search latency for the same k-recall@k. In Figure 11, we show that using FreshVamana to make updates to the index takes only a fraction of the time to rebuild it from scratch using Vamana. We show a similar comparison of DiskANN and FreshDiskANN in Table 2. Despite using more than double the resources, uilding a 800M index from scratch using DiskANN takes more than 7x the time that FreshDiskANN takes to reflect the same changes into the index. To determine the optimal value of a, we perform the FreshVamana steady-state experiments with different values of a. In the plots in Figure 3, we use the same value of a for 5This is true of any index a larger index over data from the same distribution will provide lower recall with the search parameter/complexity.

Other build and update parameters are same for each plot (R = 64, L = 75). We compare the evolution of search recall in the 95% range and average degree with different a. Finally we compare search recall versus latency for static indices built with different a to choose the best candidate. For all a > 1, average degree increases over the course of the experiments and recall stabilises around the initial value. For static indices, latency at the same recall value improves from 1 to 1.2 after which further increasing a shows now noticeable improvement as evidenced by recall-vs-latency plots for Vamana indices in Figure 13. Since we want to minimise the memory footprint of our index, we choose the a value with best search performance and lowest average degree, which in this case is 1.2. E.1.1 Search Latency vs Recall. In Figures 15 to 17, we compare the search latencies for Vamana and build timenormalized FreshVamana (build parameters adjusted to match the build time of Vamana) for various k-recall@k. For 1recall@1 and 10-recall@10, we compare latencies for 95%, 98% and 99% recall. For 100-recall@100, we compare over 98% and 99% recall because the lowest search list parameter L value gives 98% recall. E.1.2 Recall stability of FreshVamana. In Figure 18, we demonstrate k-recall@k stability of FreshVamana for commonly used k values. We show the post-insertion recall trends for 1-recall@1, 10-recall@10 and 100-recall@100. For k = 1, we show how the 95% and 99.9% recall are stable. For k = 10, we show that 95% and 99% recall are stable. For k = 100, the lowest valid search list parameter L value is 100 and this gives 98% recall. So we show the stability of 98% and 99% recall. E.2.1 Search latencies over one merge cycle. In ? ?? ?, we present the evolution of mean search latency for 100recall@100 and 10-recall@10 over the course of one merge cycle in a 800M FreshDiskANN steady-state experiment. Figure 15.

We run the merge on SIFT800M index with different thread allocations to understand the effect of merge on search latency. In Figure 8, we plot a smoothed curve of mean search latencies when merge uses 20 and 40 threads. Merge with 40 threads takes approximately half the time as that with 20, so there are two x axes adjusted to roughly align their Delete, Insert and Patch phases.

       " 'hnsw': 'Constantly growing amount of the available information resources has led to high demand in scalable and efficient similarity search data structures. One of the generally used approaches for information search is the K-Nearest Neighbor Search (K-NNS). The K-NNS assumes you have a defined distance function between the data elements and aims at finding the K elements from the dataset which minimize the distance to a given query. Such algorithms are used in many applications, such as non-parametric machine learning algorithms, image features matching in large scale databases  and semantic document retrieval . A naive approach to K-NNS is to compute the distances between the query and every element in the dataset and select the elements with minimal distance. Unfortunately, the complexity of the naive approach scales linearly with the number of stored elements making it infeasible for large-scale datasets. This has led to a high interest in development of fast and scalable KNNS algorithms. Exact solutions for K-NNS [3-5] may offer a substantial search speedup only in case of relatively low dimensional data due to “curse of dimensionality”. To overcome this problem a concept of Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (K-ANNS) was proposed, which relaxes the condition of the exact search by allowing a small number of errors. The quality of an inexact search (the recall) is defined as the ratio between the number of found true nearest neighbors and K. The most popular K-ANNS solutions are based on approximated versions of tree algorithms , locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)  and product quantization (PQ) [10-17]. Proximity graph KANNS algorithms [10, 18-26] have recently gained popularity offering a better performance on high dimensional datasets. However, the power-law scaling of the proximity graph routing causes extreme performance degradation in case of low dimensional or clustered data. In this paper we propose the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (Hierarchical NSW, HNSW), a new fully graph based incremental K-ANNS structure, which can offer a much better logarithmic complexity scaling. The main contributions are: explicit selection of the graph’s enter-point node, separation of links by different scales and use of an advanced heuristic to select the neighbors. Alternatively, Hierarchical NSW algorithm can be seen as an extension of the probabilistic skip list structure  with proximity graphs instead of the linked lists. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space method is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art approaches suitable only for vector spaces. In the vast majority of studied graph algorithms searching takes a form of greedy routing in k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graphs [10, 18-26]. For a given proximity graph, we start the search at some enter point (it can be random or supplied by a separate algorithm) and iteratively traverse the graph. At each step of the traversal the algorithm examines the distances from a query to the neighbors of a current base node and then selects as the next base node the adjacent node that minimizes the distance, while constantly keeping track of the best discovered neighbors. The search is terminated when some stopping condition is met (e.g. the number of distance calculations). Links to the closest neighbors in a k-NN graph serve as a simple approximation of the Delaunay graph  (a graph which guranties that the result of a basic greedy graph traversal is always the nearest neighbor). Unfortunately, Delaunay graph cannot be efficiently constructed without prior information about the structure of a space , but its approximation by the nearest neighbors can be done by using only distances between the stored elements. It was shown that proximity graph approaches with such approximation perform competitive to other k-ANNS thechniques, such as kd-trees or LSH [18-26]. In  authors proposed a proximity graph K-ANNS algorithm called Navigable Small World (NSW, also known as Metricized Small World, MSW), which utilized navigable graphs, i.e. graphs with logarithmic or olylogarithmic scaling of the number of hops during the greedy traversal with the respect of the network size . The NSW graph is constructed via consecutive insertion of elements in random order by bidirectionally connecting them to the M closest neighbors from the reviously inserted elements. The closest neighbors are ound using the structure’s search procedure (a variant of a greedy search from multiple random enter nodes). Links to the closest neighbors of the elements inserted in the beginning of the construction later become bridges between the network hubs that keep the overall graph connectivity and allow the logarithmic scaling of the number of hops during greedy routing. Construction phase of the NSW structure can be efficiently parallelized without global synchronization and without mesuarable effect on accuracy , being a good choice for distributed search systems. The NSW approach delivered the state-of-the-art performance on some datasets , however, due to the overall polylogarithmic complexity scaling, the algorithm was still prone to severe performance degradation on low dimensional datasets (on which NSW could lose to tree-based algorithms by several orders of magnitude ). Networks with logarithmic or polylogarithmic scaling of the greedy graph routing are known as the navigable small world networks . Such networks are an important topic of complex network theory aiming at understanding of underlying mechanisms of real-life networks formation in order to apply them for applications of scalable routing  and distributed similarity search [25, 26, 30, 37-40]. The first works to consider spatial models of navigable networks were done by J. Kleinberg  as social network models for the famous Milgram experiment . Kleinberg studied a variant of random Watts-Strogatz networks , using a regular lattice graph in ddimensional vector space together with augmentation of long-range links following a specific long link length distribution r*. For a=d the number of hops to get to the target by greedy routing scales polylogarithmically (instead of a power law for any other value of a). This idea has inspired development of many K-NNS and K-ANNS algorithms based on the navigation effect [37-40]. But even though the Kleinberg’s navigability criterion in principle can be extended for more general spaces, in order to build such a navigable network one has to know the data distribution beforehand. In addition, greedy routing in Kleinberg’s graphs suffers from polylogarithmic complexity scalability at best. Another well-known class of navigable networks are the scale-free models , which can reproduce several features of real-life networks and advertised for routing applications . However, networks produced by such models have even worse power law complexity scaling of the greedy search  and, just like the Kleinberg’s model, scale-free models require global knowledge of the data distribution, making them unusable for search applications. The above-described NSW algorithm uses a simpler, reviously unknown model of navigable networks, alowing decentralized graph construction and suitable for data in arbitrary spaces. It was suggested  that the NSW network formation mechanism may be responsible or navigability of large-scale biological neural networks (presence of which is disputable): similar models were able to describe growth of small brain networks, while the model predicts several high-level features observed in arge scale neural networks. However, the NSW model also suffers from the polylogarithmic search complexity of the routing process. from a low degree node and traverses the graph simultaneously increasing the node’s degree until the characteristic radius of the node links length reaches the scale of the distance to the query. Before the latter happens, the average degree of a node can stay relatively small, which leads to an increased probability of being stuck in a distant false local minimum. One can avoid the described problem in NSW by starting the search from a node with the maximum degree (good candidates are the first nodes inserted in the NSW structure ), directly going to the “zoom-in” phase of the search. Tests show that setting hubs as starting points substantially increases probability of successful routing in the structure and provides significantly better performance at low dimensional data. However, it still has only a polylogarithmic complexity scalability of a single greedy search at best, and performs worse on high dimensional data compared to Hierarchical NSW. The reason for the polylogarithmic complexity scaling of a single greedy search in NSW is that the overall number of distance computations is roughly proportional to a product of the average number of greedy algorithm hops by the average degree of the nodes on the greedy path. The average number of hops scales logarithmically , while the average degree of the nodes on the greedy path also scales logarithmically due to the facts that: 1) the greedy search tends to go through the same hubs as the network grows ; 2) the average number of hub connections grows logarithmically with an increase of the network size. Thus we get an overall polylogarithmic dependence of the resulting complexity. The idea of Hierarchical NSW algorithm is to separate the links according to their length scale into different layers and then search in a multilayer graph. In this case we can evaluate only a needed fixed portion of the connections for each element independently of the networks size, thus allowing a logarithmic scalability. In such structure the search starts from the upper layer which has only the longest links (the “zoom-in” phase). The algorithm greedily traverses through the elements from the upper layer until a local minimum is reached (see Fig. 1 for illustration). After that, the search switches to the lower layer (which has shorter links), restarts from the element which was the local minimum in the previous layer and the process repeats. The maximum number of connections per element in all layers can be made constant, thus allowing a logarithmic complexity scaling of routing in a navigable small world network. One way to form such a layered structure is to explicitly set links with different length scales by introducing layers. For every element we select an integer level / which defines the maximum layer for which the element belongs to. For all elements in a layer a proximity graph (i.e. graph containing only “short” links that approximate Delaunay graph) is built incrementally. If we set an exponentially decaying probability of / (i.e. following a geometric distribution) we get a logarithmic scaling of the expected number of layers in the structure. The search procedure is an iterative greedy search starting from the top layer and finishing at the zero layer. In case we merge connections from all layers, the structure becomes similar to the NSW graph (in this case the / can be put in correspondence to the node degree in NSW). In contrast to NSW, Hierarchical NSW construction algorithm does not require the elements to be shuffled before the insertion the stochasticity is achieved by using level randomization, thus allowing truly incremental indexing even in case of temporarily alterating data distribution (though changing the order of the insertion slightly alters the performace due to only partially determenistic construction procedure). Fig. 2. Illustration of the heuristic used to select the graph neighbors for two isolated clusters. A new element is inserted on the boundary of Cluster 1. All of the closest neighbors of the element belong to the Cluster 1, thus missing the edges of Delaunay graph between the clusters. The heuristic, however, selects element e2 from Cluster 2, thus, maintaining the global connectivity in case the inserted element is the closest to ez compared to any other element from Cluster 1. For the selection of the proximity graph connections during the element insertion we utilize a heuristic that takes into account the distances between the candidate elements to create diverse connections (a similar algorithm was utilized in the spatial approximation tree  to select the tree children) instead of just selecting the closest neighbors. The heuristic examines the candidates starting from the nearest (with respect to the inserted element) and creates a connection to a candidate only if it is closer to the base (inserted) element compared to any of the already connected candidates (see Section 4 for the details). When the number of candidates is large enough the heuristic allows getting the exact relative neighborhood graph  as a subgraph, a minimal subgraph of the Delaunay graph deducible by using only the distances between the nodes. The relative neighborhood graph allows easily keeping the global connected component, even in case of highly clustered data (see Fig. 2 for illustration). Note that the heuristic creates extra edges compared to the exact relative neighborhood graphs, allowing controlling the number of the connections which is important for search performance. For the case of 1D data the heuristic allows getting the exact Delaunay subgraph (which in this case coincides with the relative neighborhood graph) by using only information about the distances between the elements, thus making a direct transition from Hierarchical NSW to the 1D probabilistic skip list algorithm. Base variant of the Hierarchical NSW _ proximity graphs was also used in ref.  (called ‘sparse neighborhood graphs’) for proximity graph searching. Similar heuristic was also a focus of the FANNG algorithm  Input: multilayer graph hnsw, new element q, number of established connections M, maximum number of connections for each element per layer Mmax, size of the dynamic candidate list efConstruction, normalization factor for level generation mi Network construction algorithm (alg. 1) is organized via consecutive insertions of the stored elements into the graph structure. For every inserted element an integer maximum layer / is randomly selected with an exponentially decaying probability distribution (normalized by the m, parameter, see line 4 in alg. 1). The first phase of the insertion process starts from the top layer by greedily traversing the graph in order to find the ef closest neighbors to the inserted element gq in the layer. After that, the algorithm continues the search from the next layer using the found closest neighbors from the previous layer as enter points, and the process repeats. Closest neighbors at each layer are found by a variant of the greedy search algorithm described in alg. 2, which is an updated version of the algorithm from . To obtain the approximate ef nearest neighbors in some layer 1, a dynamic list W of ef closest found elements (initially filled with enter points) is kept during the search. The list is updated at each step by evaluating the neighborhood of the closest previously non-evaluated element in the list until the neighborhood of every element from the list is evaluated. Compared to limiting the number of distance calculations, Hierarchical NSW stop condition has an advantage it allows discarding candidates for evalution that are further from the query than the furthest element in the list, thus avoiding bloating of search structures. As in NSW, the list is emulated via two priority queues for better performance. The distinctions from NSW (along with some queue optimizations) are: 1) the enter point is a fixed parameter; 2) instead of changing the number of multi-searches, the quality of the search is controlled by a different parameter ef (which was set to K in NSW ). Input: query element q, enter points ep, number of nearest to q elements to return ef, layer number Ic During the first phase of the search the efparameter is set to 1 (simple greedy search) to avoid introduction of additional parameters. Two methods for the selection of Mneighbors from the candidates were considered: simple connection to the closest elements (alg. 3) and the heuristic that accounts for the distances between the candidate elements to create connections in diverse directions (alg. 4), described in the Section 3. The heuristic has two additional parameters: extendCandidates (set to false by default) which extends the candidate set and useful only for extremely clustered data, and keepPrunedConnections which allows getting fixed number of connection per element. The maximum number of connections that an element can have per layer is defined by the parameter M,,,, for every layer higher than zero (a special parameter M,,.9 is used for the ground layer separately). If a node is already full at the moment of making of a new connection, then its extended connection list gets shrunk by the same algorithm that used for the neighbors selection (algs. 3 or 4). The insertion procedure terminates when the connections of the inserted elements are established on the zero layer. The K-ANNS search algorithm used in Hierarchical NSW is presented in alg. 5. It is roughly equivalent to the insertion algorithm for an item with layer 40. The difference is that the closest neighbors found at the ground layer which are used as candidates for the connections are now returned as the search result. Algorithm 4 SELECT-NEIGHBORS-HEURISTIC(q, C, M, Ic, extendCandidates, keepPrunedConnections) Input: base element q, candidate elements C, number of neighbors to return M, layer number I:, flag indicating whether or not to extend candidate list extendCandidates, flag indicating whether or not to add discarded elements keepPrunedConnections Output: M elements selected by the heuristic 1R<@ 2 W<C // working queue for the candidates 3 if extendCandidates // extend candidates by their neighbors 4 foreacheeC 5 for each eas € neighbourhood(e) at layer lc 6 if eaaj € W 7 W<—WUeaaj 8 Wi<@ // queue for the discarded candidates 9 while |W| >0and |R|<M 10 e<extract nearest element from W to q 11 if eis closer to q compared to any element from R 12 R-RUe 13 else 144.

RR U extract nearest element from Wa to q 18 return R Algorithm construction parameters m, and M,,,,9 are responsible for maintaining the small world navigability in the constructed graphs. Setting m, to zero (this corresponds to a single layer in the graph) and M,,,.9 to M leads to production of directed k-NN graphs with a power-law search complexity well studied before  (assuming using the alg. 3 for neighbor selection). Setting m, to zero and M,,,,9 to infinity leads to production of NSW graphs with polylogarithmic complexity . Finally, setting m, to some non-zero value leads to emergence of controllable hierarchy graphs which allow logarithmic search complexity by introduction of layers (see the Section 3). To achieve the optimum performance advantage of the controllable hierarchy, the overlap between neighbors on different layers (i.e. percent of element neighbors that are also belong to other layers) has to be small. In order to decrease the overlap we need to decrease the m,. However, at the same time, decreasing m, leads to an increase of average hop number during a greedy search on each layer, which negatively affects the performance. This leads to existence of the optimal value for the m, parameter. A simple choice for the optimal m, is 1/In(W), this corresponds to the skip list parameter p=1/M with an average single element overlap between the layers. Simulations done on an Intel Core i7 5930K CPU show that the proposed selection of m, is a reasonable choice (see Fig. 3 for data on 10M random d=4 vectors). In addition, the plot demonstrates a massive speedup on low dimensional data when increasing the m, from zero and the effect of using the heuristic for selection of the graph connections. It is hard to expect the same behavior for high dimensional data since in this case the k-NN graph already has Fig. 3. Plots for query time vs m. parameter for 10M random vectors with d=4. The autoselected value 1/In(M) for m, is shown by very short greedy algorithm paths . Surprisingly, increasing the m, from zero leads to a measurable increase in speed on very high dimensional data (100k dense random d=1024 vectors, see plot in Fig. 4), and does not introduce any penalty for the Hierarchical NSW approach. For real data such as SIFT vectors  (which have complex mixed structure), the performance improvement by increasing the m, is higher, but less prominent at current settings compared to improvement from the heuristic (see Fig. 5 for 1-NN search performance on 5 million 128dimensional SIFT vectors from the learning set of BIGANN ). Selection of the M,,,,) (the maximum number of connections that an element can have in the zero layer) also has a strong influence on the search performance, especially in case of high quality (high recall) search. Simulations show that setting M,,,,9 to (this corresponds to kNN graphs on each layer if the neighbors selection heuristic is not used) leads to a very strong performance penalty at high recall. Simulations also suggest that 2.:Mis a good choice for M,,.¢ setting the parameter higher leads to performance degradation and excessive memory usage. In Fig. 6 there are presented results of search performance for the 5M SIFT learn dataset depending on the M,,,,9 parameter (done on an Intel Core i5 2400 CPU). The suggested value gives performance close to optimal at different recalls. Fig. 4. Plots for query time vs m. parameter for 100k random vectors with d=1024. The autoselected value 1/In(M) for m, is naive connection to the nearest neighbors (alg. 3). The effect is the most prominent for low dimensional data, at high recall for mid-dimensional data and for the case of highly clustered data (ideologically discontinuity can be regarded as a local low dimensional feature), see the omparison in Fig. 7 (Core i5 2400 CPU). When using the osest neighbors as connections for the proximity graph, the Hierarchical NSW algorithm fails to achieve a high recall for clustered data because the search stucks at the clusters boundaries. Contrary, when the heuristic is used (together with candidates’ extension, line 3 in Alg. 4), clustering leads to even higher performance. For uniform and very high dimensional data there is a little difference between the neighbors selecting methods (see Fig. 4), possibly due to the fact that in this case almost all of the nearest neighbors are selected by the heuristic. The only meaningful construction parameter left for the user is M. A reasonable range of M is from 5 to 48. Simulations show that smaller M generally produces better results for lower recalls and/or lower dimensional data, while bigger Mis better for high recall and/or high dimensional data (see Fig. 8 for illustration, Core i5 2400 CPU). The parameter also defines the memory consumption of the algorithm (which is proportional to M), so it should be selected with care. Selection of the efConstruction parameter is straightforward. As it was suggested in  it has to be large enough to produce K-ANNS recall close to unity during the construction process (0.95 is enough for the most usecases). And just like in , this parameter can possibly Fig. 6. Plots for query time vs Mmnaxo parameter for 5M SIFT learn dataset. The autoselected value 2-M for Mmaxo is shown by an arrow. Fig. 7. Effect of the method of neighbor selections (baseline corresponds to alg. 3, heuristic to alg. 4) on clustered (100 random isolated clusters) and non-clustered d=10 random vector data. Fig. 8. Plots for recall error vs query time for different parameters of M for Hierarchical NSW on 5M SIFT learn dataset. Build time, minutes Fig. 10. Plots of the query time vs construction time tradeoff for Hierarchical NSW on The construction process can be easily and efficiently parallelized with only few synchronization points (as demonstrated in Fig. 9) and no measurable effect on index quality. Construction speed/index quality tradeoff is controlled via the efConstruction parameter. The tradeoff between the search time and the index construction time is presented in Fig. 10 for a 10M SIFT dataset and shows that a reasonable quality index can be constructed for efConstruction=100 on a 4X 2.4 GHz 10-core Xeon E54650 v2 CPU server in just 3 minutes. Further increase of the efConstruction leads to little extra performance but in exchange of significantly longer construction time. The complexity scaling of a single search can be strictly analyzed under the assumption that we build exact Delaunay graphs instead of the approximate ones. Suppose we have found the closest element on some layer (this is guaranteed by having the Delaunay graph) and then descended to the next layer. One can show that the average number of steps before we find the closest element in the layer is bounded by a constant. Indeed, the layers are not correlated with the spatial positions of the data elements and, thus, when we traverse the graph there is a fixed probability p=exp(-m,) that the next node belongs to the upper layer. However, the search on the layer always terminates before it reaches the element which belongs to the higher layer (otherwise the search on the upper layer would have stopped on a different element), so the probability of not reaching the target on s-th step is bounded by exp(-s:m,). Thus the expected number of steps in a layer is bounded by a sum of geometric progression S=1/(1-exp(-m,)), which is independent of the dataset size. If we assume that the average degree of a node in the Delaunay graph is capped by a constant C in the limit of the large dataset (this is the case for random Euclid data , but can be in principle violated in exotic spaces), then the overall average number of distance evaluations in a layer is bounded by a constant C: S, independently of the dataset size. by the construction scales as O(log()), the overall complexity scaling is O(log()), in agreement with the simulations on low dimensional datasets. The inital assumption of having the exact Delaunay graph violates in Hierarchical NSW due to usage of approximate edge selection heuristic with a fixed number of neighbors per element. Thus, to avoid stucking into a local minimum the greedy search algorithm employs a backtracking procedure on the zero layer. Simulations show that at least for low dimensional data (Fig. 11, d=4) the dependence of the required ef parameter (which determines the complexity via the minimal number of hops during the backtracking) to get a fixed recall saturates with the rise of the dataset size. The backtracking complexity is an additive term in respect to the final complexity, thus, as follows from the empirical data, inaccuracies of the Delaunay graph approximation do not alter the scaling. Such empirical investigation of the Delaunay graph approximation resilience requires having the average number of Delaunay graph edges independent of the dataset to evidence how well the edges are approximated with a constant number of connections in Hierarchical NSW. However, the average degree of Delaunay graph scales exponentially with the dimensionality ), thus for high dimensional data (e.g. d=128) the aforementioned condition requires having extremely large datasets, making such empricial investigation unfeasible. Further analitical evidence is required to confirm whether the resilience of Delaunay graph aproximations generalizes to higher dimensional spaces. 4.2.2 Construction complexity The construction is done by iterative insertions of all elements, while the insertion of an element is merely a sequence of K-ANN-searches at different layers with a subsequent use of heuristic (which has fixed complexity at fixed efConstruction). The average number of layers for an element to be added in is a constant that depends on m: The memory consumption of the Hierarchical NSW is mostly defined by the storage of graph connections. The number of connections per element is M,,,,9 for the zero layer and M,,,, for all other layers. Thus, the average memory consumption per element is (Maxot Mm, -M,,,,)-bytes_per_link. If we limit the maximum total number of elements by approximately four billions, we can use four-byte unsigned integers to store the connections. Tests suggest that typical close to optimal WM values usually lie in a range between 6 and 48. This means that the typical memory requirements for the index (excluding the size of the data) are about 60-450 bytes per object, which is in a good agreement with the simulations. The Hierarchical NSW algorithm was implemented in C++ on top of the Non Metric Space Library (nmslib) \\', which already had a functional NSW implementation (under name “sw-graph”). Due to several limitations posed by the library, to achieve a better performance, the Hierarchical NSW implementation uses custom distance functions together with C-style memory management, which avoids unnecessary implicit addressing and allows efficient hardware and software prefetching during the graph traversal. Comparing the performance of K-ANNS algorithms is a nontrivial task since the state-of-the-art is constantly changing as new algorithms and implementations are emerging. In this work we concentrated on comparison with the best algorithms in Euclid spaces that have open source implementations. An implementation of the Hierarchical NSW algorithm presented in this paper is also distributed as a part of the open source nmslib library’ together with an external C++ memory-efficient headeronly version with support for incremental index construction’. The comparison section consists of four parts: comparison to the baseline NSW (5.1), comparison to the state-ofthe-art algorithms in Euclid spaces (5.2), rerun of the sub- set of tests  in general metric spaces in which NSW failed (5.3) and comparison to state-of-the-art PQalgorithms on a large 200M SIFT dataset (5.4). For the baseline NSW algorithm implementation, we used the “sw-graph” from nmslib 1.1 (which is slightly updated compared to the implementation tested in ) to demonstrate the improvements in speed and algorithmic complexity (measured by the number of distance computations). Fig. 12(a) presents a comparison of Hierarchical NSW to the basic NSW algorithm for d=4 random hypercube data made on a Core i5 2400 CPU (10-NN search). Hierarchical NSW uses much less distance computations during a search on the dataset, especially at high recalls. The scalings of the algorithms on a d=8 random hypercube dataset for a 10-NN search with a fixed recall of 0.95 are presented in Fig. 12(b). It clearly demostrates that Hierarchical NSW has a complexity scaling for this setting not worse than logarithmic and outperforms NSW at any dataset size. The performance advantage in absolute time (Fig. 12(c)) is even higher due to improved algorithm implementaion. 5.2 Comparison in Euclid spaces The main part of the comparison was carried out on vector datasets with use of the popular K-ANNS benchmark ann-benchmark’ as a testbed. The testing system utilizes python bindings of the algorithms — it consequentially runs the K-ANN search for one thousand queries (randomly extracted from the initial dataset) with preset algorithm parameters producing an output containing recall and average time of a single search. The considered algorithms are: 1. Baseline NSW “sw-graph’). 2. FLANN 1.8.4 . A popular library‘ containing several algorithms, built-in in OpenCV>. We used the available auto-tuning procedure with several reruns to infer the best parameters. 3. Annoy®, 02.02.2016 build. A popular algorithm Fig. 12. Comparison between NSW and Hierarchical NSW: (a) distance calculation number vs accuracy tradeoff for a 10 million 4dimensional random vectors dataset; (b-c) performance scaling in terms of number of distance calculations (b) and raw query(c) time on nmslib 1.1. 5. FALCONN,, version 1.2. A new efficient LSH algorithm for cosine similarity data . The comparison was done on a 4X Xeon E5-4650 v2 Debian OS system with 128 Gb of RAM. For every algorithm we carefully chose the best results at every recall range to evaluate the best possible performance (with initial values from the testbed defaults). All tests were done in a single thread regime. Hierarchical NSW was compiled using the GCC 5.3 with -Ofast optimization flag. A recent comparison of algorithms  in general spaces (i.e. non-symmetric or with violation of triangle inequality) showed that the baseline NSW algorithm has severe problems on low dimensional datasets. To test the performance of the Hierarchical NSW algorithm we have repeated a subset of tests from  on which NSW performed poorly or suboptimal. For that purpose we used a built-in nmslib testing system which had scripts to run tests from . The evaluated algorithms included the VP-tree, permutation techniques (NAPP and bruteforce filtering) [49, 55-57], the basic NSW algorithm and NNDescent-produced proximity graphs  (both in pair with the NSW graph search algorithm). As in the original tests, for every dataset the test includes the results of ei- memory management were used in this case for Hierarchical NSW leading to some performance loss. The datasets are summarized in Table 2. Further details of the datasets, spaces and algorithm parameter selection can be found in the original work . The bruteorce (BF) time is measured by the nmslib library. The results are presented in Fig. 14. Hierarchical NSW significantly improves the performance of NSW and is a leader for any of the tested datasets. The strongest enhancement over NSW, almost by 3 orders of magnitude is observed for the dataset with the lowest dimensionality, the wiki-8 with JS-divergence. This is an important result that demonstrates the robustness of Hierarchical NSW, as or the original NSW this dataset was a stumbling block. Note that for the wiki-8 to nullify the effect of implementation results are presented for the distance computations number instead of the CPU time. against PQ algorithms we used the facebook Faiss library® as the baseline (a new library with state-of-the-art PQ algorithms  implementations, released after the current manuscript was submitted) compiled with the OpenBLAS backend. The tests where done for a 200M subset of 1B SIFT dataset  on a 4X Xeon E5-4650 v2 server with 128Gb of RAM. The ann-benchmark testbed was not feasible for these experiments because of its reliance on 32-bit floating point format (requiring more than 100 Gb just to store the data). To get the results for Faiss PQ algorithms we have utilized built-in scripts with the parameters from Faiss wiki’. For the Hierarchical NSW algorithm we used a special build outside of the nmslib with a small memory footprint, simple non-vectorized The results are presented in Fig. 15 with summarization of the parameters in Table 3. The peak memory consumption was measured by using linux “time —v” tool in separate test runs after index construction for both of the algorithms. Even though Hierarchical NSW requires significantly more RAM, it can achieve much higher accuracy, while offering a massive advance in search speed and much faster index construction. By using structure decomposition of navigable small world graphs together with the smart neighbor selection heuristic the proposed Hierarchical NSW approach overcomes several important problems of the basic NSW structure advancing the state-of-the-art in K-ANN search. Hierarchical NSW offers an excellent performance and is a clear leader on a large variety of the datasets, surpassing the opensource rivals by a large margin in case of high dimensional data. Even for the datasets where the previous algorithm (NSW) has lost by orders of magnitude, Hierarchical NSW was able to come first. Hierarchical NSW supports continuous incremental indexing and can also be used as an efficient method for getting approximations of the k-NN and relative neighborhood graphs, which are byproducts of the index construction. Robustness of the approach is a strong feature which makes it very attractive for practical applications. The algorithm is applicable in generalized metric spaces performing the best on any of the datasets tested in this paper, and thus eliminating the need for complicated selection of the best algorithm for a specific problem. We stress the importance of the algorithm’s robustness since the data may have a complex structure with different effective dimensionality across the scales. For instance, a dataset can consist of points lying on a curve that randomly fills a high dimensional cube, thus being high dimensional at large scale and low dimensional at small scale. In order to perform efficient search in such datasets an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm has to work well for both cases of high and low dimensionality. There are several ways to further increase the efficiency and applicability of the Hierarchical NSW approach. There is still one meaningful parameter left which strongly affects the construction of the index — the number of added connections per layer M. Potentially, this parameter can be inferred directly by using different heuristics . It would also be interesting to compare Hierarchical NSW on the full 1B SIFT and 1B DEEP datasets [10-14] and add support for element updates and removal. proach compared to the basic NSW is the loss of the possibility of distributed search. The search in the Hierarchical NSW structure always starts from the top layer, thus the structure cannot be made distributed by using the same techniques as described in  due to cognestion of the higher layer elements. Simple workarounds can be used to distribute the structure, such as partitioning the data across cluster nodes studied in , however in this case, the total parallel throughput of the system does not scale well with the number of computer nodes. Still, there are other possible known ways to make this particular structure distributed. Hierarchical NSW is idelogically very similar to the well-known oneimensional exact search probabilistic skip list structure, nd thus can use the same techniques to make the strucure distributed . Potentially this can lead to even beter distributed performance compared to the base NSW ue to logarithmic scalability and ideally uniform load on e nodes. 4] G.

       " 'ivfpq': 'Article in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence January 2011 Abstract— This paper introduces a product quantization based approach for approximate nearest neighbor search. The idea is to decomposes the space into a Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. A vector is represented by a short code composed of its subspace quantization indices. The Euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes. An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a dataset of two billion vectors. Index Terms— High-dimensional indexing, image indexing, very large databases, approximate search. Computing Euclidean distances between high dimensional vectors is a fundamental requirement in many applications. It is used, in particular, for nearest neighbor (NN) search. Nearest neighbor search is inherently expensive due to the curse of dimensionality , . Focusing on the D-dimensional Euclidean space R?, the problem is to find the element NN(z), in a finite set Y C R® of n vectors, minimizing the distance to the query vector « € R? : Several multi-dimensional indexing methods, such as the popular KD-tree  or other branch and bound techniques, have been proposed to reduce the search time. However, for high dimensions it turns out  that such approaches are not more efficient than the bruteforce exhaustive distance calculation, whose complexity is O(nD). There is a large body of literature , ,  on algorithms that overcome this issue by performing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. The key idea This work was partly realized as part of the Quaero Programme, funded by OSEO, French State agency for innovation. It was originally published as a technical report  in August 2009. It is also related to the work  on source coding for nearest neighbor search. shared by these algorithms is to find the NN with high probability “only”, instead of probability 1. Most of the effort has been devoted to the Euclidean distance, though recent generalizations have been proposed for other metrics . In this paper, we consider the Euclidean distance, which is relevant for many applications. In this case, one of the most popular ANN algorithms is the Euclidean Locality-Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH) , , which provides theoretical guarantees on the search quality with limited assumptions. It has been successfully used for local descriptors  and 3D object indexing , . However, for real data, LSH is outperformed by heuristic methods, which exploit the distribution of the vectors. These methods include randomized KD-trees  and hierarchical k-means , both of which are implemented in the FLANN selection algorithm . ANN algorithms are typically compared based on the trade-off between search quality and efficiency. However, this trade-off does not take into account the memory requirements of the indexing structure. In the case of E2LSH, the memory usage may even be higher than that of the original vectors. Moreover, both E2LSH and FLANN need to perform a final re-ranking step based on exact L2 distances, which requires the indexed vectors to be stored in main memory if access speed is important. This constraint seriously limits the number of vectors that can be handled by these algorithms. Only recently, researchers came up with methods limiting the memory usage. This is a key criterion for problems involving large amounts of data , ie., in large-scale scene recognition , where millions to billions of images have to be indexed. In , Torralba et al. represent an image by a single global GIST descriptor  which is mapped to a short binary code. When no supervision is used, this mapping is learned such that the neighborhood in the embedded space defined by the Hamming distance reflects the neighborhood in the Euclidean space of the original features. The search of the Euclidean nearest neighbors is then approximated by the search of the nearest neighbors in terms of Hamming distances between codes. In , spectral hashing (SH) is shown to outperform the binary codes generated by the restricted Boltzmann machine , boosting and LSH. In this paper, we construct short codes using quantization. The goal is to estimate distances using vectorto-centroid distances, i.e., the query vector is not quantized, codes are assigned to the database vectors only. This reduces the quantization noise and subsequently improves the search quality. To obtain precise distances, the quantization error must be limited. Therefore, the total number k of centroids should be sufficiently large, eg. k= 2%4 for 64-bit codes. This raises several issues on how to learn the codebook and assign a vector. First, the number of samples required to learn the quantizer is huge, i.e., several times k. Second, the complexity of the algorithm itself is prohibitive. Finally, the amount of computer memory available on Earth is not sufficient to store the floating point values representing the centroids. The hierarchical k-means see (HKM) improves the efficiency of the learning stage and of the corresponding assignment procedure . However, the aforementioned limitations still apply, in particular with respect to memory usage and size of the learning set. Another possibility are scalar quantizers, but they offer poor quantization error properties in terms of the trade-off between memory and reconstruction error. Lattice quantizers offer better quantization properties for uniform vector distributions, but this condition is rarely satisfied by real world vectors. In practice, these quantizers perform significantly worse than k-means in indexing tasks . In this paper, we focus on product quantizers. To our knowledge, such a semi-structured quantizer has never been considered in any nearest neighbor search method. The advantages of our method are twofold. First, the number of possible distances is significantly higher than for competing Hamming embedding methods , , , as the Hamming space used in these techniques allows for a few distinct distances only. Second, as a byproduct of the method, we get an estimation of the expected squared distance, which is required for e-radius search or for using Lowe’s distance ratio criterion . The motivation of using the Hamming space in , ,  is to compute distances efficiently. Note, however, that one of the fastest ways to compute Hamming distances consists in using table lookups. Our method uses a similar number of table lookups, resulting in comparable efficiency. Our paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the notations for quantization as well as the product quantizer used by our method. Section III presents our approach for NN search and Section IV introduces the structure used to avoid exhaustive search. An evaluation of the parameters of our approach and a comparison with the state of the art is given in Section V. Quantization is a destructive process which has been extensively studied in information theory . Its purpose is to reduce the cardinality of the representation space, in particular when the input data is real-valued. Formally, a quantizer is a function g mapping a Ddimensional vector « € R? to a vector q(x) € C = {ci;i © Z}, where the index set Z is from now on assumed to be finite: Z = 0... — 1. The reproduction values c; are called centroids. The set of reproduction values C is the codebook of size k. The Lloyd quantizer, which corresponds to the kmeans clustering algorithm, finds a near-optimal codebook by iteratively assigning the vectors of a training set to centroids and re-estimating these centroids from the assigned vectors. In the following, we assume that the two Lloyd conditions hold, as we learn the quantizer using k-means. Note, however, that k-means does only find a local optimum in terms of quantization error. cae) =— [ daaa)) rade. i Sy, Note that the MSE can be obtained from these quantities as MSE(q) = )> pi €(;¢)1) ieL The memory cost of storing the index value, without any further processing (entropy coding), is [log, k] bits. Therefore, it is convenient to use a power of two for k, as the code produced by the quantizer is stored in a binary memory. the SIFT descriptor . A quantizer producing 64bits codes, i.e., “only” 0.5 bit per component, contains Storing the codebook C explicitly is not efficient. Instead, we store the m x k* centroids of all the subquantizers, i.e., mD* k* = k* D floating points values. Quantizing an element requires k*D floating point operations. Table I summarizes the resource requirements associated with k-means, HKM and product k-means. The product quantizer is clearly the the only one that can be indexed in memory for large values of k. In order to provide good quantization properties when choosing a constant value of k*, each subvector should have, on average, a comparable energy. One way to ensure this property is to multiply the vector by a random orthogonal matrix prior to quantization. However, for most vector types this is not required and not recommended, as consecutive components are often correlated by construction and are better quantized together with the same subquantizer. As the subspaces are orthogonal, the squared distortion associated with the product quantizer is where MSE(q;) is the distortion associated with quantizer q;. Figure 1 shows the MSE as a function of the code length for different (m,k*) tuples, where the code length is 1 = mlog,k*, if k* is a power of two. The curves are obtained for a set of 128-dimensional SIFT descriptors, see section V for details. One can observe that for a fixed number of bits, it is better to use a small number of subquantizers with many centroids than having many subquantizers with few bits. At the extreme when m = 1, the product quantizer becomes a regular k-means codebook. 0.3 T T T m=1 —+— m=2 ---x--0.25 + m=4 --o-J m=8 --4 i= m=16 ---&-OG 02 4 < fe} 2 3 0.15 4 3 2 S$ O17 4 B 0.05 + aoe 4 > a . 1 y 0 16 32 64 96 128 160 Fig. 2. Illustration of the symmetric and asymmetric distance computation. The distance d(x, y) is estimated with either the distance d(q(x),q(y)) (left) or the distance d(x,q(y)) (right). The mean squared error on the distance is on average bounded by the quantization error. Nearest neighbor search depends on the distances between the query vector and the database vectors, or equivalently the squared distances. The method introduced in this section compares the vectors based on their quantization indices, in the spirit of source coding techniques. We first explain how the product quantizer properties are used to compute the distances. Then we provide a statistical bound on the distance estimation error, and propose a refined estimator for the squared Euclidean distance. Symmetric distance computation (SDC): both the vectors x and y are represented by their respective centroids q(x) and q(y). The distance d(x, y) is approximated by the distance d(x, y) * d(q(x),q(y)) which is efficiently obtained using a product quantizer As shown later in this subsection, using the estimations d or d leads to underestimate, on average, the distance between descriptors. Figure 3 shows the distances obtained when querying a SIFT descriptor in a dataset of 1000 SIFT vectors. It compares the true distance against the estimates computed with Equations 12 and 13. One can clearly see the bias on these distance estimators. Unsurprisingly, the symmetric version is more sensitive to this bias. Discussion: Figure 4 illustrates the probability distribution function of the difference between the true distance and the ones estimated by Equations 13 and 25. It has been measured on a large set of SIFT descriptors. The bias of the distance estimation by Equation 13 is significantly reduced in the corrected version. However, we observe that correcting the bias leads, in this case, to a higher variance of the estimator, which is a common phenomenon in statistics. Moreover, for the nearest neighbors, the correcting term is likely to be higher 0 Ts. L -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 difference: estimator d(x,y) In our experiments, we observe that the correction returns inferior results on average. Therefore, we advocate the use of Equation 13 for the nearest neighbor search. The corrected version is useful only if we are interested in the distances themselves. Approximate nearest neighbor search with product quantizers is fast (only m additions are required per distance calculation) and reduces significantly the memory requirements for storing the descriptors. Nevertheless, the search is exhaustive. The method remains scalable in the context of a global image description , . However, if each image is described by a set of local descriptors, an exhaustive search is prohibitive, as we need to index billions of descriptors and to perform multiple queries . To avoid exhaustive search we combine an inverted file system  with the asymmetric distance computation (IVFADC). An inverted file quantizes the descriptors and stores image indices in the corresponding lists, see the step “coarse quantizer” in Figure 5. This allows rapid access to a small fraction of image indices and was shown successful for very large scale search . Instead of storing an image index only, we add a small code for each descriptor, as first done in . Here, we encode the difference between the vector and its Similar to the “Video-Google” approach , a codebook is learned using k-means, producing a quantizer qc, referred to as the coarse quantizer in the following. For SIFT descriptors, the number k’ of centroids associated with gq typically ranges from k’ = 1000 to k’ = 1000 000. It is therefore small compared to that of the product quantizers used in Section III. G > ac(y) + aly — aely))9) Denoting by 9p; the 7\" subquantizer, we use the following decomposition to compute this estimator efficiently: ; G1) Similar to the ADC strategy, for each subquantizer pj the distances between the partial residual vector uj (a qe(y)) and all the centroids c;,; of Gp, are preliminarily computed and stored. address this problem, we use the multiple assignment strategy of . The query x is assigned to w indexes instead of only one, which correspond to the w nearest neighbors of x in the codebook of qc. All the corresponding inverted lists are scanned. Multiple assignment is not applied to database vectors, as this would increase the memory usage. 4) add a new entry to the inverted list corresponding to g-(y). It contains the vector (or image) identifier and the binary code (the product quantizer’s indexes). Searching the nearest neighbor(s) of a query x consists of 1) quantize x to its w nearest neighbors in the codebook q; with these w assignments. The two steps are applied to all w assignments. 4) select the K nearest neighbors of x based on the estimated distances. This is implemented efficiently by maintaining a Maxheap structure of fixed capacity, that stores the AK smallest values seen so far. After each distance calculation, the point identifier is added to the structure only if its distance is below the largest distance in the Maxheap. Only Step 3 depends on the database size. Compared with ADC, the additional step of quantizing x to g-(x) consists in computing k’ distances between Ddimensional vectors. Assuming that the inverted lists are balanced, about n x w/k’ entries have to be parsed. Therefore, the search is significantly faster than ADC, as shown in the next section. In this section, we first present the datasets used for the evaluation’. We then analyze the impact of the parameters for SDC, ADC and IVFADC. Our approach is compared to three state-of-the-art methods: spectral hashing , Hamming embedding  and FLANN . Finally, we evaluate the complexity and speed of our approach. The search quality is measured with recall@ R, ie., the proportion of query vectors for which the nearest neighbor is ranked in the first R positions. This measure indicates the fraction of queries for which the nearest neighbor is retrieved correctly, if a short-list of R vectors is verified using Euclidean distances. Furthermore, the curve obtained by varying R corresponds to the distribution function of the ranks, and the point R=1 corresponds to the “precision” measure used in  to evaluate ANN methods. As expected, the asymmetric estimator ADC significantly outperforms SDC. For m=8 we obtain the same accuracy for ADC and k*=64 as for SDC and k*=256. Given that the efficiency of the two approaches is equivalent, we advocate not to quantize the query when possible, but only the database elements. 1 ; — 0.8 + 6 4 S o6F xo 4 5 bid 8 o4b x JKet6 | i¢ 1! m=1 —+— O2x! no J fs m=16 —--— 0 \\\\ L L L n 0 16 32 64 96 128 160 code length (bits) Fig. 6. SDC and ADC estimators evaluated on the SIFT dataset: recall@100 as a function of the memory usage (code length=m x log, k*) for different parameters (k*=16,64,256,...,4096 and m=1,2,4,8,16). The missing point (m=16,k*=4096) gives recall@100=1 for both SDC and ADC. 0.20 L 1 L 0 16 32 64 96 128 code length (bits) This approach is significantly more efficient than SDC and ADC on large datasets, as it only compares the query to a small fraction of the database vectors. The proportion of the dataset to visit is roughly linear in w/k’. For a fixed proportion, it is worth using higher values of k’, as this increases the accuracy, as shown by comparing, for the tuple (m,w), the parameters (1024, 1) against (8192, 8) and (1024, 8) against (8192, 64). The natural order corresponds to grouping consecutive components, as proposed in Equation 8. For the SIFT descriptor, this means that histograms of neighboring grid cells are quantized together. GIST descriptors are composed of three 320-dimension blocks, one per color channel. The product quantizer splits these blocks into parts. The “structured” order consists in grouping together dimensions that are related. For the m = 4 SIFT quantizer, this means that the 4x 4 patch cells that make up the descriptor  are grouped into 4 2 x 2 blocks. For the other two, it groups together dimensions that have have the same index modulo 8. The orientation histograms of SIFT and most of GIST’s have 8 bins, so this ordering quantizes together bins corresponding to the same orientation. On SIFT descriptors, this is a slightly less efficient structure, probably because the natural order corresponds to spatially related components. On GIST, this choice significantly improves the performance. Therefore, we use this ordering in the following experiments. Discussion: A method that automatically groups the components could further improve the results. This seems particularly important if we have no prior knowledge about the relationship between the components as in the case of bag-of-features. A possible solution is the minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering  algorithm. Comparison with Hamming embedding methods: We compare our approach to spectral hashing (SH) , which maps vectors to binary signatures. The search consists in comparing the Hamming distances between the database signatures and the query vector signature. This approach was shown to outperform the restricted Boltzmann machine of . We have used the publicly available code. We also compare to the Hamming embedding (HE) method of , which also maps vectors to binary signatures. Similar to IVFADC, HE uses an inverted file, which avoids comparing to all the database elements. . — —— oor = 0.8 4 xc 06 5 © @ § 2 04 sDC —— 4 ADC ---x--IVFADC w=1 ° 0.2 IVFADC w=16 ~~ J .

GIST dataset: recall@R for varying values of R. Comparison of the different approaches SDC, ADC, IVFADC and spectral hashing . We have used m=8, k*=256 for SDC/ADC and k’ = 1024 for IVFADC. Comparison with FLANN: The approximate nearestneighbor search technique of Muja & Lowe  is based on hierarchical structures (KD-trees and hierarchical kmeans trees). The software package FLANN automatically selects the best algorithm and parameters for a given dataset. In contrast with our method and spectral hashing, all vectors need to remain in RAM as the method includes a re-ranking stage that computes the real distances for the candidate nearest neighbors. For the sake of comparison with FLANN, we added a verification stage to our IVFADC method: IVFADC queries return a shortlist of R candidate nearest neighbors using the distance estimation. The vectors in the shortlist are re-ordered using the real distance, as done in , , and the closest one is returned. Note that, in this experimental setup, all the vectors are stored in main memory. This requirement seriously limits the scale on which re-ordering can be used. The IVFADC and FLANN methods are both evaluated at different operating points with respect to precision and search time. For FLANN, the different operating points are obtained with parameters generated automatically for various target precisions. For IVFADC, they are obtained by varying the number k’ of coarse centroids, the number w of assignments and the short-list size R. The product quantizer is generated using k*=256 and m=8, ie., 64bit codes. This choice is probably not optimal for all operating points. Table V reports the search time of our methods. For reference, we report the results obtained with the spectral hashing algorithm of  on the same dataset and machine (using only one core). Since we use a separate learning set, we use the out-of-sample evaluation of this algorithm.

IVFADC vs FLANN: trade-offs between search quality To evaluate the search efficiency of the product quantizer method on larger datasets we extracted about 2 billion SIFT descriptors from one million images. Search is performed with 30000 query descriptors from ten images. We compared the IVFADC and HE methods with similar parameters. In particular, the amount of memory that is scanned for each method and the cost of the coarse quantization are the same. The query times per descriptor are shown on Figure 11. The cost of the extra quantization step required by IVFADC appears clearly for small database sizes. For larger scales, the distance computation with the database vectors become preponderant.

Comparison of IVFADC and the Hamming Embedding We have evaluated our method within an image search system based on local descriptors. For this evaluation, we compare our method with the HE method of  on the INRIA Holidays dataset, using the pre-processed set of descriptors available online. The comparison is focused on large scale indexing, i.e., we do not consider the impact of a post-verification step ,  or geometrical We have introduced product quantization for approximate nearest neighbor search. Our compact coding scheme provides an accurate approximation of the Euclidean distance. Moreover, it is combined with an inverted file system to avoid exhaustive search, resulting in high efficiency. Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in terms of the trade-off between search quality and memory usage. Experimental results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors are excellent and show that grouping the components based on our prior knowledge of the descriptor design further improves the results. The scalability of our approach is validated on a dataset of two billion vectors. H. Jégou, M. Douze, and C.

If our chunks are too small or too large, it may lead to imprecise search results or missed opportunities to surface relevant content. As a rule of thumb, if the chunk of text makes sense without the surrounding context to a human, it will make sense to the language model as well.
